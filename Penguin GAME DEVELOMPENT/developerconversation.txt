im working on a game in gamemaker and am trying to figure out and resolve my game crashing when trying to repair obj_building, can you take a look at the combined gml object event code and script code and provide either new full event code to fix the bug or being troubleshooting and debugging the current code to fix it. Can you also tell me if I need to create any other objects or sprites to add to the room, what objects should be in the room to make it work? Setting scheduler resolution to 1

ERROR in action number 1
of  Step Event0 for object obj_building:

Bug Analysis & Fix for obj_building Repair System Crash
The error you're encountering:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
ERROR in action number 1
of Step Event0 for object obj_building:
unable to convert string "Wood" to int64
at gml_Object_obj_building_Step_0 (line 27) - var needed_amount = required_items[item_name];
suggests that there is an issue with retrieving values from required_items. Let's break it down:

Key Findings from Your Code (obj_building Step Event)
required_items is defined as a struct:

gml
Copy
Edit
required_items = { "Wood": 1, "Snow": 1 };
This means "Wood" and "Snow" should be valid keys to retrieve values.

The error occurs at:

gml
Copy
Edit
var needed_amount = required_items[item_name];
This suggests item_name might not be correctly formatted.

Possible Causes & Fix
Ensure item_name is a String

The line var item_name = string(item_keys[i]); is already converting it to a string, so this should be fine.
Check if the Key Exists in the Struct

Before accessing required_items[item_name], use:
gml
Copy
Edit
if (!variable_struct_exists(required_items, item_name)) {
    show_debug_message("ERROR: Key '" + item_name + "' does not exist in required_items!");
    continue; // Skip this iteration
}
Validate needed_amount is a Real Number

The error message suggests the retrieval might be returning an incorrect type.
Add an explicit check:
gml
Copy
Edit
var needed_amount = required_items[item_name];
if (!is_real(needed_amount)) {
    show_debug_message("ERROR: Value for '" + item_name + "' is not a valid number.");
    continue;
}
Final Fixed Code (Step Event)
gml
Copy
Edit
// Ensure player exists
if (!instance_exists(global.player_instance)) exit;

var player = global.player_instance;

// Convert struct keys into an array
var item_keys = variable_struct_get_names(required_items);
show_debug_message("Building Repair Items: " + string(item_keys));

// Check for repair initiation
if (distance_to_object(player) < 16 && repair_stage < max_repair_stage) {
    if (keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {
        var has_items = true;

        // Check if player has required resources
        for (var i = 0; i < array_length(item_keys); i++) {
            var item_name = item_keys[i]; // Keep original key type

            // Validate key exists
            if (!variable_struct_exists(required_items, item_name)) {
                show_debug_message("ERROR: Required item key '" + item_name + "' does not exist in required_items!");
                has_items = false;
                break;
            }

            var needed_amount = required_items[item_name];

            // Validate that the value is a real number
            if (!is_real(needed_amount)) {
                show_debug_message("ERROR: Value for '" + item_name + "' is not a valid number.");
                has_items = false;
                break;
            }

            if (obj_inventory.get_item_count(item_name) < needed_amount) {
                has_items = false;
                show_debug_message("Missing " + item_name + " (" + string(needed_amount) + ")");
                break;
            }
        }

        // Start repair if resources are sufficient
        if (has_items) {
            repairing = true;
            show_debug_message("Repair started!");
        } else {
            show_debug_message("Not enough materials!");
        }
    }
}

// Repair progress logic
if (repairing) {
    repair_progress += 1;

    if (repair_progress >= repair_max) {
        repair_progress = 0;
        repair_stage += 1;
        image_index = repair_stage;

        // If fully repaired, deduct items
        if (repair_stage == max_repair_stage) {
            repairing = false;
            for (var i = 0; i < array_length(item_keys); i++) {
                var item_name = item_keys[i];

                if (variable_struct_exists(required_items, item_name)) {
                    obj_inventory.remove_item(item_name, required_items[item_name]);
                } else {
                    show_debug_message("ERROR: Tried to remove invalid key '" + item_name + "' from inventory!");
                }
            }
            show_debug_message(building_name + " repaired!");
        }
    }
}
Changes & Fixes
✅ Ensures required_items keys exist before accessing them.
✅ Confirms needed_amount is a real number before using it.
✅ Uses correct item_name without unnecessary string() conversion.

Additional Objects Needed in Room
From your provided GML files, the following objects should be in the room:

obj_building (the building to repair)
obj_inventory (tracks player’s items)
obj_player (player instance to interact with the building)
obj_repair_ui (optional UI for repair prompt)
obj_dropped_item (items that can be picked up for repair)
Let me know if you need more debugging! 🚀

item_type = ""; // Set when the object is created
sprite_index = spr_inventory_items;

// Check if player picks up the item
if (distance_to_object(global.player_instance) < 16 && keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {
    obj_inventory.add_to_inventory(item_type);
    instance_destroy();
}
These scripts should allow obj_repair_ui to show repair prompts and obj_dropped_item to handle item pickups properly. Let me know if you need adjustments! 🚀

Bug Fix for obj_building Step Event
The error message:

ERROR in action number 1
of Step Event0 for object obj_building:
unable to convert string "Wood" to int64
 at gml_Object_obj_building_Step_0 (line 26) - var needed_amount = required_items[item_name];
indicates that the required_items struct is not behaving as expected. Specifically, required_items[item_name] is causing a type mismatch, likely due to item_name not matching the exact keys in required_items.

Fix
1. Check If item_name Exists in required_items
Before accessing required_items[item_name], validate that item_name exists using variable_struct_exists().

gml
Copy
Edit
if (!variable_struct_exists(required_items, item_name)) {
    show_debug_message("ERROR: Key '" + item_name + "' does not exist in required_items!");
    continue; // Skip this iteration
}
2. Ensure needed_amount Is a Number
gml
Copy
Edit
var needed_amount = required_items[item_name];
if (!is_real(needed_amount)) {
    show_debug_message("ERROR: Value for '" + item_name + "' is not a valid number.");
    continue;
}

What This Fix Does
✅ Ensures required_items keys exist before accessing them.
✅ Confirms needed_amount is a real number before using it.
✅ Uses correct item_name without unnecessary string() conversion.

Updated Debugging & Fix for obj_building Step Event Crash
Issue Breakdown
The error message:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
ERROR in action number 1
of Step Event0 for object obj_building:
unable to convert string "Wood" to int64
 at gml_Object_obj_building_Step_0 (line 26) - var needed_amount = required_items[item_name];
indicates that required_items[item_name] is returning something unexpected.

Why Is This Happening?
item_name Might Not Match the Expected Keys

The script logs show "Building Repair Items: [ "Wood","Snow" ]" is correctly stored.
However, item_name might be incorrectly formatted or retrieved.
required_items Might Not Be a Struct

If required_items is undefined or empty, accessing required_items[item_name] will cause a crash.
We need to confirm its initialization.
item_name Could Be an Unexpected Data Type

If item_name contains unwanted characters (e.g., spaces), it won't match required_items["Wood"].
Fix: Validate Data Before Accessing
Modify the obj_building Step Event:

gml
Copy
Edit
// Ensure player exists
if (!instance_exists(global.player_instance)) exit;

var player = global.player_instance;

// Ensure required_items is a valid struct
if (!is_struct(required_items)) {
    show_debug_message("ERROR: required_items is not a valid struct!");
    exit;
}

// Convert struct keys into an array
var item_keys = variable_struct_get_names(required_items);
show_debug_message("Building Repair Items: " + string(item_keys));

// Check for repair initiation
if (distance_to_object(player) < 16 && repair_stage < max_repair_stage) {
    if (keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {
        var has_items = true;

        // Check if player has required resources
        for (var i = 0; i < array_length(item_keys); i++) {
            var item_name = string(item_keys[i]); // Ensure it's a string

            // Debugging
            show_debug_message("Checking required item: " + item_name);

            // Validate key exists
            if (!variable_struct_exists(required_items, item_name)) {
                show_debug_message("ERROR: Key '" + item_name + "' does not exist in required_items!");
                has_items = false;
                break;
            }

            var needed_amount = required_items[item_name];

            // Validate that the value is a real number
            if (!is_real(needed_amount)) {
                show_debug_message("ERROR: Value for '" + item_name + "' is not a valid number.");
                has_items = false;
                break;
            }

            if (obj_inventory.get_item_count(item_name) < needed_amount) {
                has_items = false;
                show_debug_message("Missing " + item_name + " (" + string(needed_amount) + ")");
                break;
            }
        }

        // Start repair if resources are sufficient
        if (has_items) {
            repairing = true;
            show_debug_message("Repair started!");
        } else {
            show_debug_message("Not enough materials!");
        }
    }
}

// Repair progress logic
if (repairing) {
    repair_progress += 1;

    if (repair_progress >= repair_max) {
        repair_progress = 0;
        repair_stage += 1;
        image_index = repair_stage;

        // If fully repaired, deduct items
        if (repair_stage == max_repair_stage) {
            repairing = false;
            for (var i = 0; i < array_length(item_keys); i++) {
                var item_name = string(item_keys[i]);

                if (variable_struct_exists(required_items, item_name)) {
                    obj_inventory.remove_item(item_name, required_items[item_name]);
                } else {
                    show_debug_message("ERROR: Tried to remove invalid key '" + item_name + "' from inventory!");
                }
            }
            show_debug_message(building_name + " repaired!");
        }
    }
}
What This Fix Does
✅ Checks if required_items is a struct before accessing it.
✅ Ensures item_name is a string before using it.
✅ Logs each step to pinpoint errors more effectively.
✅ Avoids crashes if an item key doesn't exist.

Next Steps
Run the game and check the debug logs

If required_items is not a valid struct! appears, it means the struct isn't properly initialized.
If Key 'Wood' does not exist in required_items! appears, the struct keys might have unwanted spaces or incorrect casing.
Confirm required_items Initialization

Add this to obj_initializer Create Event:
gml
Copy
Edit
if (!variable_global_exists("required_items")) {
    global.required_items = { "Wood": 1, "Snow": 1 };
    show_debug_message("DEBUG: required_items initialized in obj_initializer.");
}

Issue Breakdown & New Debugging Steps
The error message:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
ERROR in action number 1
of Step Event0 for object obj_building:
unable to convert string "Wood" to int64
at gml_Object_obj_building_Step_0 (line 35) - var needed_amount = required_items[item_name];
This means that required_items[item_name] is not returning an integer. Instead, it's likely returning undefined or a string instead of a number.

New Debugging Steps
We need to confirm:

Is required_items actually a struct?
It looks like it's initialized in obj_initializer, but we need to check if it still exists in obj_building.
Is item_name correctly formatted and matches the struct keys exactly?
"Wood" must be a valid key inside required_items.
What is required_items[item_name] actually returning?
It should return a number like 1, but if it returns undefined or something unexpected, we need to fix it.
Fix: Add More Debugging Logs
Modify obj_building Step Event:

gml
Copy
Edit
// Ensure player exists
if (!instance_exists(global.player_instance)) exit;

var player = global.player_instance;

// Debug: Check if required_items exists
if (!is_struct(required_items)) {
    show_debug_message("ERROR: required_items is not a valid struct in obj_building!");
    exit;
}

// Convert struct keys into an array
var item_keys = variable_struct_get_names(required_items);
show_debug_message("Building Repair Items: " + string(item_keys));

// Check for repair initiation
if (distance_to_object(player) < 16 && repair_stage < max_repair_stage) {
    if (keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {
        var has_items = true;

        // Check if player has required resources
        for (var i = 0; i < array_length(item_keys); i++) {
            var item_name = string(item_keys[i]); // Ensure it's a string

            // Debugging
            show_debug_message("Checking required item: " + item_name);

            // Validate key exists
            if (!variable_struct_exists(required_items, item_name)) {
                show_debug_message("ERROR: Key '" + item_name + "' does not exist in required_items!");
                has_items = false;
                break;
            }

            var needed_amount = required_items[item_name];

            // Debugging: Check what `needed_amount` actually is
            show_debug_message("DEBUG: needed_amount for '" + item_name + "' = " + string(needed_amount));

            // Validate that the value is a real number
            if (!is_real(needed_amount)) {
                show_debug_message("ERROR: Value for '" + item_name + "' is not a valid number. It is type: " + typeof(needed_amount));
                has_items = false;
                break;
            }

            if (obj_inventory.get_item_count(item_name) < needed_amount) {
                has_items = false;
                show_debug_message("Missing " + item_name + " (" + string(needed_amount) + ")");
                break;
            }
        }

        // Start repair if resources are sufficient
        if (has_items) {
            repairing = true;
            show_debug_message("Repair started!");
        } else {
            show_debug_message("Not enough materials!");
        }
    }
}
Expected Debug Log Outputs
If required_items is missing, you'll see:
csharp
Copy
Edit
ERROR: required_items is not a valid struct in obj_building!
If item_name does not exist in required_items:
vbnet
Copy
Edit
ERROR: Key 'Wood' does not exist in required_items!
If needed_amount is not a number:
pgsql
Copy
Edit
ERROR: Value for 'Wood' is not a valid number. It is type: <unexpected type>
Next Steps
Run the game and check the debug messages.
If needed_amount is not a number, let me know what type it says.
If required_items is missing, we might need to reassign it properly.
🚀 Let me know what the debug messages say!

############################################################################################
gml_Object_obj_building_Step_0 (line 35)
The issue is that required_items[item_name] is expected to return a real number, but instead, it might be returning undefined or a string.
The struct exists (DEBUG: required_items initialized in obj_initializer.), and the keys appear to be correct (Building Repair Items: [ "Wood", "Snow" ]).
The key lookup is failing, or the value retrieved is not a number.
Root Cause
Possible Key Formatting Issue

item_name might contain extra spaces or different capitalization compared to required_items.
Possible Value Type Issue

The value stored in required_items["Wood"] might be a string instead of a number.

                show_debug_message("Missing " + item_name + " (" + string(needed_amount) + ")");
                break;
            }
        }

        // Start repair if resources are sufficient
        if (has_items) {
            repairing = true;
            show_debug_message("Repair started!");
        } else {
            show_debug_message("Not enough materials!");
        }
    }
}
What This Fix Does
✅ Logs the exact type and value of needed_amount before using it.
✅ If needed_amount is a string, it converts it to a real number.
✅ Prevents crashes due to incorrect types.

Next Steps
Run the game and check the debug logs for:
DEBUG: needed_amount for 'Wood' = ... (Type: ...)
WARNING: Converted needed_amount for 'Wood' to real: ...
If needed_amount was stored as a string, this fix will correct it.
If there's still an issue, copy the exact debug output here.

New Debugging Insights & Next Fix
The error persists at:

Edit
ERROR in action number 1
of Step Event0 for object obj_building:
unable to convert string "Wood" to int64
 at gml_Object_obj_building_Step_0 (line 35) - var needed_amount = required_items[item_name];
This means required_items[item_name] is still returning an incorrect data type.

Key Observations from Debug Logs
required_items is correctly initialized.
Keys exist and match exactly ("Wood", "Snow").
needed_amount should be an integer, but it's failing to convert.
This strongly suggests that the value of required_items["Wood"] is a string instead of a real number.

Final Fix: Ensure Numeric Values
Modify obj_initializer Create Event
We will force required_items values to be numbers from the start:

gml
Copy
Edit
if (!variable_global_exists("required_items")) {
    global.required_items = {
        "Wood": real(1),  // Ensure it's stored as a number
        "Snow": real(1)
    };
    show_debug_message("DEBUG: required_items initialized in obj_initializer.");
}
Modify obj_building Step Event (Last Fix)
Ensure needed_amount is always a real number:

gml
Copy
Edit
var needed_amount = required_items[item_name];

// Debugging: Log actual value & type
show_debug_message("DEBUG: needed_amount for '" + item_name + "' = " + string(needed_amount) + " (Type: " + typeof(needed_amount) + ")");

// Force conversion if it's a string
if (typeof(needed_amount) == "string") {
    needed_amount = real(needed_amount);
    show_debug_message("WARNING: Converted needed_amount for '" + item_name + "' to real: " + string(needed_amount));
}

// Ensure final check before use
if (!is_real(needed_amount)) {
    show_debug_message("ERROR: Value for '" + item_name + "' is still not a valid number.");
    exit; // Prevents crash
}
Expected Debug Log Fix
If the issue was a string type, you should now see:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
WARNING: Converted needed_amount for 'Wood' to real: 1
and no more crashes!

Next Steps
Apply the real() fix in obj_initializer.
Run the game and check the logs.
If the crash persists, copy the debug output here.
🚀 This should be the final fix! Let me know what happens.

Issue Analysis & New Fix for obj_building Crash
The error persists:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
ERROR in action number 1
of Step Event0 for object obj_building:
unable to convert string "Wood" to int64
 at gml_Object_obj_building_Step_0 (line 35) - var needed_amount = required_items[item_name];
This confirms that required_items[item_name] is still returning an incorrect type.

What We've Confirmed So Far
✅ required_items is initialized properly.
✅ item_name is correctly set as "Wood" or "Snow".
✅ The error persists even after attempting to convert values.

This strongly suggests that required_items[item_name] is being retrieved as a string, even though it's stored as a number.
The issue could be how GameMaker handles struct keys internally when accessing data.

Final Fix: Explicitly Convert to Real Before Storing & Using
1. Modify obj_initializer Create Event to Store Numbers Explicitly
Change this:

gml
Copy
Edit
if (!variable_global_exists("required_items")) {
    global.required_items = {
        "Wood": real(1),
        "Snow": real(1)
    };
}
To this (explicit conversion before storing):

gml
Copy
Edit
if (!variable_global_exists("required_items")) {
    global.required_items = {};
    global.required_items["Wood"] = real(1);
    global.required_items["Snow"] = real(1);
    show_debug_message("DEBUG: required_items initialized in obj_initializer.");
}
✅ Why? Some versions of GameMaker may store struct values incorrectly if declared inline.

2. Modify obj_building Step Event (Force real() Conversion)
Change this:

gml
Copy
Edit
var needed_amount = required_items[item_name];
To this:

gml
Copy
Edit
var needed_amount = real(required_items[item_name]);
✅ Why? This forces GameMaker to treat the value as a number before using it.

Expected Outcome
After applying these fixes:

The game should no longer crash.
The debug logs should show:
pgsql
Copy
Edit
DEBUG: required_items initialized in obj_initializer.
Checking required item: 'Wood'
DEBUG: needed_amount for 'Wood' = 1 (Type: real)
If needed_amount is still a string, it will now properly convert to a number before use.
Next Steps
Apply these fixes.
Run the game and check for any errors.
If it still crashes, post the full debug log again.
🚀 This should finally fix the issue! Let me know how it goes!

ChatGPT said:
Fixing Syntax Errors in obj_initializer Create Event
The errors suggest that:

There's an issue with how real(1) is being assigned in a struct.
GameMaker expects a different syntax when accessing struct properties.
A syntax issue exists when assigning values inside the struct.
Fixed obj_initializer Create Event
Try this corrected version:

gml
Copy
Edit
if (!variable_global_exists("required_items")) {
    global.required_items = new struct(); // Initialize as a struct

    global.required_items.Wood = 1; // Assign integer values directly
    global.required_items.Snow = 1;

    show_debug_message("DEBUG: required_items initialized in obj_initializer.");
}
✅ Why this works:

new struct() properly initializes required_items instead of {}.
Using global.required_items.Wood = 1; correctly assigns values.
No real() function is needed because integers are assigned directly.
Final Step: Ensure Proper Access in obj_building
Modify the Step Event:

gml
Copy
Edit
var needed_amount = real(global.required_items[? item_name]); // Use '?' accessor
✅ Why?

Structs in GameMaker should use [? key] for safe access.
real() ensures the retrieved value is always a number.
Next Steps
Apply these fixes.
Run the game and check the logs.
Let me know if any errors persist.
🚀 This should fully resolve the issue!

Uses [? "Key"] syntax to safely assign values.
Prevents errors from missing struct initialization.
Ensure Proper Access in obj_building Step Event
Modify:

gml
Copy
Edit
var needed_amount = real(global.required_items[? item_name]); // Use '?' accessor
✅ Why?

[? item_name] ensures safe retrieval from the struct.
real() guarantees the value is numeric.
Next Steps
Apply this fix to obj_initializer.
Run the game and check if required_items initializes correctly.
If errors persist, share the latest debug logs.
🚀 This should finally resolve the struct initialization issue!
