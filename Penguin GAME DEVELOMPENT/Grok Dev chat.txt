You are an expert GameMaker Studio 2 developer, a master in game design and a code optimization expert.I will provide you with GameMaker Language (GML) code. Can you analyse both gml file and gml script files to gain an understanding of the current object codebase used in my project. You will maintain a consistent understanding of the game's mechanics, logic systems, and design goals as I describe them.  Please provide clear and concise instructions to guide me in adding and implementing your changes and revised code into my project. I want to be able to quickly copy and paste the updated code into my project for testing. I have recently added a new special action that the obj_player can use, action state throw. It uses various scripts and objects; get_throw_direction, get_throw_animation_data, obj_snowball & obj_player among others. Everything functions regarding the code that draws the sprite and "throws" the snowball. However whenever the player presses O and the throw animation plays out it look like it flickering and that mulitple throw sprites are being drawn ontop or next to each other. Are you able to understand the various realationshops and decipher the complex throw snowball sprite frame data to fix and resolve my issues?

Alright, let's tackle this issue. So, the player has a special action where they can throw a snowball by pressing 'O'. The throw animation seems to be flickering, and it looks like multiple throw sprites are being drawn on top of or next to each other. I need to figure out what's causing this and fix it.
First, I should understand how the throw animation is being handled. From the code snippets provided, it seems like the throw animation is managed in the obj_player's Step event. There's a condition that checks if the player is in the THROW state, and if so, it handles the animation and snowball throwing logic.
Let me look at the relevant part of the Step event:
gml

if (action_state == THROW) {
    if (!throwing) {
        throwing = true;
        throw_frame = 0;
        var throw_dir = get_throw_direction(face);
        snowball = instance_create_layer(x, y, "Instances", obj_snowball);
        snowball.direction = throw_dir;
        snowball.speed = 5;
    }
    var throw_data = get_throw_animation_data(face);
    var frame_offset = throw_data[0];
    var flip = throw_data[1];
    throw_frame += 0.2; // Animation speed
    if (throw_frame >= 28) {
        throwing = false;
        action_state = IDLE;
    } else {
        var frame = floor(throw_frame) + frame_offset;
        draw_sprite_ext(spr_player_throw, frame, x, y, flip ? -1 : 1, 1, 0, c_white, 1);
    }
}

Wait, actually, this code seems to be drawing the sprite directly in the Step event, which is unusual because drawing should typically be done in the Draw event. But in GameMaker, it's possible to draw in the Step event, though it's not recommended as it can lead to issues like the one described.
Perhaps the flickering is due to the sprite being drawn multiple times per frame or not being cleared properly. Let's think about how GameMaker handles drawing.
In GameMaker, the Draw event is where you should handle all drawing operations. If you draw in the Step event, it might interfere with the normal drawing process, especially if the object also has a Draw event or if there are multiple draw calls.
Looking back at the obj_player's code, I see that there is a Draw event defined:
gml

// Draw Event for obj_player
if (action_state == THROW) {
    var throw_data = get_throw_animation_data(face);
    var frame_offset = throw_data[0];
    var flip = throw_data[1];
    var frame = floor(throw_frame) + frame_offset;
    draw_sprite_ext(spr_player_throw, frame, x, y, flip ? -1 : 1, 1, 0, c_white, 1);
} else {
    // Existing drawing code for other states
    draw_sprite_part(spr_player_body, 0, frame_x, frame_y, 24, 24, x, y);
    draw_sprite_part_ext(spr_player_colour, 0, frame_x, frame_y, 24, 24, x, y, 1, 1, global.player_color, 1);
    // Draw equipped items if any
}

Wait, actually, in the provided code, the Draw event doesn't seem to handle the throw animation. Let me check again.
Looking at the Draw event code:
gml

// Draw Event for obj_player
var frame_width = 24;
var frame_height = 24;
var frame_x = 0;
var frame_y = 0;

if (action_state == SPECIAL_ACTION) {
    // Handle special action sprites here based on equipped item
    var special_sprite = get_special_action_sprite(global.equipped_items.hand); // Example for hand item
    if (special_sprite != -1) {
        frame_x = special_sprites[face][0];
        frame_y = special_sprites[face][1];
        draw_sprite_part(special_sprite, 0, frame_x, frame_y, frame_width, frame_height, x, y);
        return; // Skip drawing the player body and color
    }
} else if (action_state == THROW) {
    var throw_data = get_throw_animation_data(face);
    var frame_offset = throw_data[0];
    var flip = throw_data[1];
    var frame = floor(throw_frame) + frame_offset;
    draw_sprite_ext(spr_player_throw, frame, x, y, flip ? -1 : 1, 1, 0, c_white, 1);
    return;
}

// Normal drawing logic
frame_x = sitting_sprites[face][0];
frame_y = sitting_sprites[face][1];
draw_sprite_part(spr_player_body, 0, frame_x, frame_y, frame_width, frame_height, x, y);
draw_sprite_part_ext(spr_player_colour, 0, frame_x, frame_y, frame_width, frame_height, x, y, 1, 1, global.player_color, 1);

// Draw equipped items if any

Wait, in this version, it seems that the Draw event does handle the throw animation. So, in the Step event, there's code that updates the throw_frame and creates the snowball, but the actual drawing is in the Draw event.
But in the earlier snippet, it looked like there was a draw_sprite_ext call in the Step event. Maybe that was a mistake or an older version.
Let me confirm: in the provided code, the Draw event has:
gml

if (action_state == THROW) {
    var throw_data = get_throw_animation_data(face);
    var frame_offset = throw_data[0];
    var flip = throw_data[1];
    var frame = floor(throw_frame) + frame_offset;
    draw_sprite_ext(spr_player_throw, frame, x, y, flip ? -1 : 1, 1, 0, c_white, 1);
    return;
}

So, the throw animation is being drawn in the Draw event, which is correct. However, perhaps there is still an issue with how the frames are being calculated or displayed.
Let me think about what could cause flickering. Flickering often occurs when the sprite is being drawn multiple times per frame or when the frame index is not being updated correctly.
In this case, since the drawing is in the Draw event, and it's using draw_sprite_ext with a specific frame, it should be fine as long as throw_frame is being updated correctly.
Wait, in the Step event, there's:
gml

if (action_state == THROW) {
    if (!throwing) {
        throwing = true;
        throw_frame = 0;
        var throw_dir = get_throw_direction(face);
        snowball = instance_create_layer(x, y, "Instances", obj_snowball);
        snowball.direction = throw_dir;
        snowball.speed = 5;
    }
    throw_frame += 0.2; // Animation speed
    if (throw_frame >= 28) {
        throwing = false;
        action_state = IDLE;
    }
}

So, throw_frame is being incremented by 0.2 each step, and when it reaches 28, the throw action ends.
Then, in the Draw event, the frame is calculated as floor(throw_frame) + frame_offset.
Assuming that spr_player_throw has frames 0 to 27 for the throw animation in one direction, and perhaps 28 to 55 for another, as suggested by the get_throw_animation_data function.
Let me look at that function:
gml

function get_throw_animation_data(direction) {
    var frame_offset = 0;
    var flip = false;
    switch (direction) {
        case DOWN:
        case DOWN_RIGHT:
        case RIGHT:
            frame_offset = 0; // Frames 0–27
            flip = false;
            break;
        case UP:
        case UP_RIGHT:
            frame_offset = 28; // Frames 28–55
            flip = false;
            break;
        case DOWN_LEFT:
        case LEFT:
            frame_offset = 0;
            flip = true;
            break;
        case UP_LEFT:
            frame_offset = 28;
            flip = true;
            break;
    }
    return [frame_offset, flip];
}

So, for directions DOWN, DOWN_RIGHT, RIGHT, it uses frames 0-27 without flipping.
For UP and UP_RIGHT, it uses frames 28-55 without flipping.
For DOWN_LEFT and LEFT, it uses frames 0-27 with horizontal flipping.
For UP_LEFT, it uses frames 28-55 with horizontal flipping.
This suggests that the sprite sheet has throw animations for two main directions, and the others are achieved by flipping.
Now, the issue might be related to how the frame is calculated. Since throw_frame is incremented by 0.2 each step, and the animation has 28 frames, the total animation time would be 28 / 0.2 = 140 steps, which at 60 FPS is about 2.33 seconds, which seems reasonable.
But perhaps the flickering is due to the way the frame is being floored. For example, if throw_frame is 0.2, floor(0.2) is 0, then 0.4 is still 0, and so on, until it reaches 1.0, where floor(1.0) is 1.
Wait, actually, since it's floor(throw_frame), and throw_frame increases by 0.2 each step, the frame will stay the same for 5 steps (since 1 / 0.2 = 5), then move to the next frame.
So, each frame of the animation is displayed for 5 steps, which at 60 FPS is about 0.083 seconds per frame, which is quite fast. Maybe the animation is too fast, causing it to look like it's flickering.
Alternatively, perhaps the sprite sheet has multiple frames that look similar, and when played quickly, it appears as if multiple sprites are overlapping.
Another possibility is that the draw_sprite_ext call is being executed multiple times somehow, but since it's in the Draw event, it should only be called once per frame.
Wait,Unless the object has multiple instances or something, but since it's the player, there should be only one instance.
Alternatively, maybe there are other draw calls that are drawing the player sprite on top of the throw animation.
Looking back at the Draw event, after drawing the throw animation, it has a return statement, so it should skip the rest of the drawing code.
Wait, actually, in the code snippet, it says:
gml

if (action_state == THROW) {
    // draw throw animation
    return;
}

So, yes, it returns after drawing the throw animation, so the normal player sprite shouldn't be drawn.
But perhaps there are other objects or effects that are drawing additional sprites.
Another thing to check is if the throw animation sprite has multiple subimages that are similar or overlapping, causing the flickering effect.
Alternatively, maybe the animation speed is too high, and slowing it down would help.
Let me try to adjust the animation speed. Currently, throw_frame += 0.2 each step. If I make it slower, say throw_frame += 0.1, then each frame would be displayed for 10 steps, which is 0.166 seconds per frame, which might be better.
But before changing that, perhaps I can add some debug output to see what's happening.
For example, in the Draw event, I can add:
gml

if (action_state == THROW) {
    show_debug_message("Drawing throw frame: " + string(floor(throw_frame)) + " with offset: " + string(frame_offset));
    // rest of the code
}

This way, I can see which frames are being drawn and if they are changing correctly.
Also, I can check if the draw event is being called multiple times or if there are multiple player instances.
Additionally, perhaps the issue is with the sprite itself. Maybe the spr_player_throw sprite has transparent or semi-transparent pixels that are causing overlapping effects.
Another idea: since the throw animation is using draw_sprite_ext with flipping for some directions, maybe the flipping is not being applied correctly, or the sprite is not designed to be flipped.
For example, if the sprite has asymmetrical elements, flipping it might not look right.
But since it's a throw animation, it might be designed to be symmetrical or to work with flipping.
Alternatively, perhaps the frame calculation is wrong, and it's trying to draw frames outside the available range.
For instance, if frame_offset is 28 and throw_frame is 27, then frame = 27 + 28 = 55, which might be the last frame, but if the sprite has fewer than 56 frames, it could wrap around or cause errors.
Wait, in GameMaker, if you specify a subimage index greater than the number of frames, it usually wraps around, but it might not look good if the sprite isn't designed for that.
So, I should check how many subimages spr_player_throw has.
Assuming it has 56 frames (0-55), as suggested by the offsets.
But to be sure, I can add a check:
gml

var total_frames = sprite_get_number(spr_player_throw);
if (frame >= total_frames) {
    show_debug_message("Warning: Trying to draw frame " + string(frame) + " but sprite has only " + string(total_frames) + " frames.");
}

This way, I can see if it's trying to draw invalid frames.
Another potential issue could be that the throw_frame is not being reset properly or that the animation is looping incorrectly.
But in the code, when throw_frame >= 28, it sets throwing = false and action_state = IDLE, so it should stop the animation after 28 frames.
Wait, actually, since the frame is floor(throw_frame) + frame_offset, and throw_frame goes from 0 to 27.8 (since 0.2 * 139 = 27.8, and at 140 steps, throw_frame >= 28), so floor(throw_frame) will be 0 to 27, and with frame_offset, it will be 0 to 27 or 28 to 55, depending on the direction.
So, if the sprite has at least 56 frames, it should be fine.
But perhaps the animation is too fast, and slowing it down would help.
Alternatively, maybe the flickering is due to the way the snowball is being created or drawn.
Wait, the snowball is created once when throwing starts, and it's a separate object, so it should be drawn separately.
But perhaps the snowball's draw event is interfering somehow, though it's unlikely.
Another thing to consider is if there are any effects or particles that are being drawn along with the throw animation.
For example, if there's a snowball trail or something, but from the code, it seems just the player and the snowball.
Wait, actually, in the Step event, when throwing starts, it creates the snowball instance, but the snowball has its own Draw event, which is just draw_self(), so it should be fine.
Perhaps the issue is with the player's position or the snowball's position overlapping in a way that causes visual artifacts.
But that seems unlikely.
Let me think about another approach. Maybe I can temporarily remove the snowball creation and see if the animation still flickers. If it does, then the issue is with the animation itself.
Alternatively, I can try to draw a different sprite or a solid color rectangle instead of the throw sprite to see if the flickering persists.
For example, in the Draw event:
gml

if (action_state == THROW) {
    draw_rectangle(x - 12, y - 12, x + 12, y + 12, false);
    return;
}

If this doesn't flicker, then the issue is with the sprite or the way it's being drawn.
If it still flickers, then perhaps there's something wrong with the draw event or the object's properties.
Also, I can check if the object's image_speed or other properties are affecting the drawing.
Wait, in the Create event, image_speed is set to 0, so it shouldn't be animating automatically.
Additionally, in the throw animation, we're manually controlling the frame with draw_sprite_ext, so image_index shouldn't matter.
But to be safe, I can set image_index to 0 or -1 when in the throw state.
For example, in the Step event when action_state == THROW, set image_index = 0;
Though since we're using draw_sprite_ext with a specific frame, it shouldn't be necessary.
Another idea: perhaps the game is running at a high frame rate, and the animation is too fast. Maybe capping the animation speed or making it frame-rate independent would help.
For instance, instead of throw_frame += 0.2, I can use throw_frame += 0.2 * (delta_time / 1000000), but since GameMaker's room_speed is usually 60, and delta_time is in microseconds, it's probably not necessary.
Wait, actually, in GameMaker Studio 2, you can use delta_time for frame-rate independent movement, but for animation, since the steps are tied to the room_speed, it's usually fine.
But if the room_speed is very high, the animation might be too fast.
Alternatively, perhaps the player can trigger multiple throw actions quickly, causing overlapping animations.
But in the code, when action_state == THROW, it doesn't allow changing state until the animation finishes.
Wait, actually, looking at the Step event:
gml

if (action_state != THROW && keyboard_check_pressed(ord("O"))) {
    action_state = THROW;
    throwing = false;
}

So, it only sets action_state to THROW if it's not already THROW, and when the animation finishes, it sets action_state back to IDLE.
So, it should prevent multiple throw actions from overlapping.
Unless the player presses 'O' multiple times quickly, but since it checks if action_state != THROW, it should only trigger once.
Wait, actually, if the player holds 'O', since it's keyboard_check_pressed, it should only trigger once per press.
But perhaps if the animation is long, and the player presses 'O' again after the animation finishes, it could start another throw, but that shouldn't cause flickering during the animation.
Another possibility is that the draw event is being called multiple times or that there are multiple player instances.
But since it's the player, there should be only one instance.
To check, I can add a debug message in the Draw event:
gml

show_debug_message("Drawing player instance: " + string(id));

And see if it's being called multiple times per frame.
If it's only called once, then that's not the issue.
Alternatively, maybe there are other objects drawing similar sprites.
For example, if there's a shadow or effect object that's drawing something similar.
But from the code provided, it seems just the player and the snowball.
Wait, perhaps the snowball is being drawn multiple times or something.
Let me check the obj_snowball's Draw event:
gml

draw_self();

So, it's just drawing itself, which should be fine.
Another idea: maybe the throw animation sprite has multiple layers or effects that are causing the flickering.
For example, if the sprite has semi-transparent pixels or if it's designed to be drawn with blending modes.
But by default, draw_sprite_ext uses the normal blending mode.
Perhaps I can try setting the blend mode explicitly:
gml

draw_set_alpha(1);
draw_set_blend_mode(bm_normal);
draw_sprite_ext(...);
draw_set_blend_mode(bm_normal);

But it's probably not necessary.
Wait, another thought: perhaps the player's depth is changing or conflicting with other objects.
But since the player is likely at a specific depth, and the snowball is at another depth, it should be fine.
Alternatively, maybe the camera or view is moving in a way that affects the drawing.
But that seems unlikely.
Let me try to summarize:
The throw animation is drawn in the Draw event using draw_sprite_ext with a calculated frame.

The frame is based on throw_frame, which increments by 0.2 each step.

Each frame is displayed for 5 steps.

The animation has 28 frames, so total animation time is 140 steps.

The issue is that it looks like multiple throw sprites are being drawn on top or next to each other, causing flickering.

Perhaps the problem is that the animation is too fast, and the frames are changing too quickly, making it look like multiple frames are visible at once.
In animation, if the frames change too rapidly, it can create a strobing or flickering effect, especially if the frames have high contrast or if the animation is not smooth.
So, maybe slowing down the animation would help.
For example, change throw_frame += 0.1 instead of 0.2, so each frame is displayed for 10 steps, making the animation twice as slow.
Alternatively, I can adjust the animation speed based on the number of frames and desired total animation time.
For instance, if I want the animation to last 1 second at 60 FPS, then for 28 frames, the increment should be 28 / 60 ≈ 0.4667 per step.
Wait, actually, to calculate the increment:
Let total_frames = 28;
Let desired_duration = 60; // steps, e.g., 1 second at 60 FPS
Then, increment = total_frames / desired_duration;
So, for a 1-second animation, increment = 28 / 60 ≈ 0.4667;
For a 2-second animation, increment = 28 / 120 ≈ 0.2333;
Currently, with 0.2, it's slightly slower than 2 seconds.
But perhaps for a throw animation, 1 second is more appropriate.
So, I can try setting throw_frame += 0.4667;
Or, to make it precise, I can use a timer.
For example, in the Step event:
if (thrown) {
    throw_timer += 1;
    if (throw_timer >= throw_duration) {
        throwing = false;
        action_state = IDLE;
        throw_timer = 0;
    }
}
Then, in the Draw event:
var progress = throw_timer / throw_duration;
var frame = floor(progress * 28) + frame_offset;
draw_sprite_ext(spr_player_throw, frame, x, y, flip ? -1 : 1, 1, 0, c_white, 1);
This way, the animation progresses smoothly over the desired duration.
But since GameMaker's draw_sprite_ext uses integer frames, it should be fine as is.
Wait, another potential issue: perhaps the sprite has subimages that are not properly aligned or have different sizes, causing visual artifacts.
But assuming the sprite sheet is correctly set up, that shouldn't be the case.
Alternatively, maybe the x and y coordinates are not aligned to pixels, causing subpixel rendering issues.
In GameMaker, if you draw at non-integer coordinates, it can cause blurry or flickering sprites.
So, I can try rounding the x and y coordinates when drawing.
For example:
var draw_x = floor(x);
var draw_y = floor(y);
draw_sprite_ext(spr_player_throw, frame, draw_x, draw_y, flip ? -1 : 1, 1, 0, c_white, 1);
This might help if the player's position is fractional.
Additionally, I can check if the player is moving during the throw animation. If the player is moving while throwing, it could cause the sprite to appear to flicker as it moves.
But in the code, when action_state == THROW, the movement code might still be executing, depending on how it's structured.
Looking back at the Step event, it seems that when action_state == THROW, it doesn't handle movement, but earlier in the Step event, there is movement code:
gml

// Handle movement input only if not in THROW state
if (action_state != THROW) {
    // Movement code
}

Wait, actually, in the provided code, it's:
gml

if (action_state == IDLE || action_state == WALKING) {
    // Movement code
}

So, when action_state == THROW, the movement code is not executed, so the player shouldn't be moving.
Therefore, that shouldn't be the issue.
Wait, unless there's other code that moves the player.
Another idea: perhaps the camera is moving or shaking, causing the player to appear to flicker.
But again, that seems unlikely.
Let me consider if there's any other draw event or effect that could be interfering.
For example, if there's a post-processing effect or a shader applied, but from the code, it doesn't seem so.
Alternatively, maybe the game has a high refresh rate, and the animation is not synced properly.
But in GameMaker, the draw event is tied to the game loop, so it should be consistent.
Wait, perhaps I can try to lock the animation to specific frames.
For example, instead of using throw_frame += 0.2, I can use a timer to change the frame every N steps.
For instance:
in Create event:
throw_frame = 0;
throw_step = 0;
throw_frame_duration = 5; // change frame every 5 steps
then in Step event:
if (action_state == THROW) {
    throw_step += 1;
    if (throw_step >= throw_frame_duration) {
        throw_step = 0;
        throw_frame += 1;
        if (throw_frame >= 28) {
            throwing = false;
            action_state = IDLE;
            throw_frame = 0;
        }
    }
}
then in Draw event:
var frame = throw_frame + frame_offset;
draw_sprite_ext(spr_player_throw, frame, x, y, flip ? -1 : 1, 1, 0, c_white, 1);
This way, each frame is displayed for exactly throw_frame_duration steps, which might make the animation smoother.
By adjusting throw_frame_duration, I can control the speed of the animation.
For example, if throw_frame_duration = 3, each frame is displayed for 3 steps, so the total animation time is 28 * 3 = 84 steps, about 1.4 seconds at 60 FPS.
If throw_frame_duration = 5, total animation time is 28 * 5 = 140 steps, about 2.33 seconds.
I can experiment with different values to see what looks best.
Additionally, I can add interpolation or easing to make the animation smoother, but for sprite animation, it's usually not necessary.
Another thing to consider is if the sprite has a consistent art style or if there are frames that are significantly different, causing visual jumps.
But without seeing the sprite, it's hard to say.
In conclusion, I think the most likely cause is that the animation is too fast, and slowing it down by adjusting the throw_frame increment or using a frame duration approach might help.
So, I recommend trying to change throw_frame += 0.1 instead of 0.2, or implementing the frame duration method.
Also, adding debug messages to check the frame being drawn can help verify if the animation is proceeding as expected.
For example:
in Draw event:
if (action_state == THROW) {
    show_debug_message("Throw frame: " + string(throw_frame) + ", drawn frame: " + string(frame));
    // draw code
}
This way, you can see the sequence of frames being drawn and ensure there are no jumps or repeats.
If after trying these adjustments the issue persists, it might be necessary to look at the sprite itself or check for other draw calls that could be interfering.
But I hope this helps resolve the flickering issue with the throw animation.

Understanding the Issue
Your query describes a problem with the obj_player's throw animation in GameMaker Studio 2, triggered by pressing the 'O' key. The animation flickers, appearing as if multiple throw sprites are being drawn on top of or next to each other. The relevant code involves the obj_player's Step and Draw events, the obj_snowball object, and scripts like get_throw_direction and get_throw_animation_data. The throwing mechanics work correctly (e.g., the snowball is created and moves), but the visual presentation of the animation is problematic. Let's analyze the codebase and provide a solution.
Analyzing the Codebase
Step Event (obj_player)
The Step event handles the throw action's logic:
gml

if (action_state != THROW && keyboard_check_pressed(ord("O"))) {
    action_state = THROW;
    throwing = false;
}

if (action_state == THROW) {
    if (!throwing) {
        throwing = true;
        throw_frame = 0;
        var throw_dir = get_throw_direction(face);
        snowball = instance_create_layer(x, y, "Instances", obj_snowball);
        snowball.direction = throw_dir;
        snowball.speed = 5;
    }
    throw_frame += 0.2; // Animation speed
    if (throw_frame >= 28) {
        throwing = false;
        action_state = IDLE;
    }
}

Logic Flow: When 'O' is pressed and the player isn’t already throwing, action_state becomes THROW. On the first frame of THROW, throwing is set to true, throw_frame resets to 0, and a snowball is created. throw_frame then increments by 0.2 each step until it reaches 28, ending the animation.

Animation Duration: With throw_frame += 0.2, each frame lasts 5 steps (1 / 0.2 = 5), and 28 frames take 140 steps (28 / 0.2), or ~2.33 seconds at 60 FPS.

Draw Event (obj_player)
The Draw event renders the throw animation:
gml

if (action_state == THROW) {
    var throw_data = get_throw_animation_data(face);
    var frame_offset = throw_data[0];
    var flip = throw_data[1];
    var frame = floor(throw_frame) + frame_offset;
    draw_sprite_ext(spr_player_throw, frame, x, y, flip ? -1 : 1, 1, 0, c_white, 1);
    return;
}

Drawing: When action_state is THROW, it calculates the current frame using floor(throw_frame) + frame_offset and draws spr_player_throw with optional flipping.

Frame Calculation: throw_frame (0 to 27.8) is floored to an integer (0 to 27), then offset by frame_offset (0 or 28, per get_throw_animation_data).

Return Statement: Ensures only the throw sprite is drawn, preventing overlap with other states’ sprites.

get_throw_animation_data Script
This determines the sprite sheet offset and flipping:
gml

function get_throw_animation_data(direction) {
    var frame_offset = 0;
    var flip = false;
    switch (direction) {
        case DOWN:
        case DOWN_RIGHT:
        case RIGHT:
            frame_offset = 0; // Frames 0–27
            flip = false;
            break;
        case UP:
        case UP_RIGHT:
            frame_offset = 28; // Frames 28–55
            flip = false;
            break;
        case DOWN_LEFT:
        case LEFT:
            frame_offset = 0;
            flip = true;
            break;
        case UP_LEFT:
            frame_offset = 28;
            flip = true;
            break;
    }
    return [frame_offset, flip];
}

Sprite Sheet: spr_player_throw has at least 56 frames: 0–27 for down/right, 28–55 for up, with left directions flipping 0–27 and up-left flipping 28–55.

Potential Causes of Flickering
Multiple Draw Calls: If the Draw event is called multiple times per frame or multiple player instances exist, sprites could overlap. The return statement and single-player design (global.player_instance) make this unlikely.

Animation Speed: throw_frame += 0.2 means each frame displays for 5 steps (~0.083 seconds at 60 FPS), which might be too fast, causing a strobing effect if frames contrast sharply.

Subpixel Rendering: Non-integer x or y coordinates could cause visual artifacts.

Sprite Design: If spr_player_throw frames have transparency issues or misalignment, rapid frame changes might exaggerate this.

Solution
The most likely cause is the animation speed being too fast, leading to a flickering effect. Let’s slow it down and ensure smooth rendering. We’ll also add safeguards for position rounding and debug checks.
Step 1: Adjust Animation Speed
Modify the Step event to use a slower increment, e.g., 0.1 (10 steps per frame, ~0.166 seconds at 60 FPS), making the animation ~4.67 seconds total:
gml

// In obj_player Step Event
if (action_state != THROW && keyboard_check_pressed(ord("O"))) {
    action_state = THROW;
    throwing = false;
}

if (action_state == THROW) {
    if (!throwing) {
        throwing = true;
        throw_frame = 0;
        var throw_dir = get_throw_direction(face);
        snowball = instance_create_layer(x, y, "Instances", obj_snowball);
        snowball.direction = throw_dir;
        snowball.speed = 5;
    }
    throw_frame += 0.1; // Slower animation speed
    if (throw_frame >= 28) {
        throwing = false;
        action_state = IDLE;
    }
}

Step 2: Enhance Draw Event
Round coordinates to prevent subpixel issues and add debug output:
gml

// In obj_player Draw Event
if (action_state == THROW) {
    var throw_data = get_throw_animation_data(face);
    var frame_offset = throw_data[0];
    var flip = throw_data[1];
    var frame = floor(throw_frame) + frame_offset;
    var draw_x = floor(x);
    var draw_y = floor(y);
    draw_sprite_ext(spr_player_throw, frame, draw_x, draw_y, flip ? -1 : 1, 1, 0, c_white, 1);
    show_debug_message("Throw frame: " + string(floor(throw_frame)) + ", drawn frame: " + string(frame));
    return;
}
// Rest of Draw event for other states...

Step 3: Verify Sprite Frames
Ensure spr_player_throw has 56 frames (0–55). In GameMaker’s sprite editor:
Check the frame count.

Preview the animation at 6 FPS (0.1 * 60) to confirm smoothness.

Implementation Instructions
Update Step Event:
Open obj_player in GameMaker.

Go to the Step event.

Replace the existing throw-related code with:
gml

if (action_state != THROW && keyboard_check_pressed(ord("O"))) {
    action_state = THROW;
    throwing = false;
}

if (action_state == THROW) {
    if (!throwing) {
        throwing = true;
        throw_frame = 0;
        var throw_dir = get_throw_direction(face);
        snowball = instance_create_layer(x, y, "Instances", obj_snowball);
        snowball.direction = throw_dir;
        snowball.speed = 5;
    }
    throw_frame += 0.1;
    if (throw_frame >= 28) {
        throwing = false;
        action_state = IDLE;
    }
}

Update Draw Event:
Go to the Draw event in obj_player.

Replace the THROW block with:
gml

if (action_state == THROW) {
    var throw_data = get_throw_animation_data(face);
    var frame_offset = throw_data[0];
    var flip = throw_data[1];
    var frame = floor(throw_frame) + frame_offset;
    var draw_x = floor(x);
    var draw_y = floor(y);
    draw_sprite_ext(spr_player_throw, frame, draw_x, draw_y, flip ? -1 : 1, 1, 0, c_white, 1);
    show_debug_message("Throw frame: " + string(floor(throw_frame)) + ", drawn frame: " + string(frame));
    return;
}

Test the Animation:
Run the game.

Press 'O' to trigger the throw.

Observe the animation and check the Output window for frame numbers (0–27 or 28–55, depending on direction).

If flickering persists, adjust throw_frame += 0.1 to 0.05 (20 steps per frame, ~9.33 seconds total).

Sprite Check:
Open spr_player_throw in the sprite editor.

Verify it has 56 frames.

If not, update the sprite or adjust the code’s frame limit (if (throw_frame >= 28)) to match the actual frame count.

Additional Debugging (If Needed)
If the issue remains:
Check Instances: Add show_debug_message("Player instances: " + string(instance_number(obj_player))); in the Step event to ensure only one obj_player exists.

Sprite Review: Examine spr_player_throw frames for transparency or alignment issues.

This should resolve the flickering by smoothing the animation and ensuring precise rendering. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!

I think you were on to something in your initial thought session. [Wait, actually, this code seems to be drawing the sprite directly in the Step event, which is unusual because drawing should typically be done in the Draw event. But in GameMaker, it's possible to draw in the Step event, though it's not recommended as it can lead to issues like the one described.] obj_player draws the throw sprites twice, once in the step event and the other in the draw event. The current throw animation is all wrong. Its all flickering and the flipped sprites are offset wrong but the step event draw code works almost perfectly when I moved it to the obj_players draw event temporarily, however after the animation starts I get this error:

Expand for details

Let me think through this step by step. So, the problem is with the throw animation in the obj_player, specifically that it's flickering and the flipped sprites are offset incorrectly. There's also an error about an unknown variable "use_up_right" in the Draw event.
First, I need to understand how the throw animation is supposed to work. From the code, it seems like when the player presses 'O', the action_state is set to "throw", and the throw_direction is captured based on the player's facing direction at that moment. Then, in the Step event, there's logic to handle the animation timing and to create the snowball at a specific frame.
In the Draw event, there's code that tries to determine which set of frames to use for the throw animation based on the throw_direction. It uses variables like use_up_right and flip to decide whether to use the "Throw Face Down Right" or "Throw Face Up Right" animations and whether to flip them horizontally.
However, there's an error in the Draw event: "Variable <unknown_object>.use_up_right(100432, -2147483648) not set before reading it." This suggests that use_up_right is not defined in the scope where it's being used. Looking at the code, use_up_right is defined within the if (action_state == "throw") block, so it should be accessible within that block. Wait, actually, in the code snippet provided, it seems like the Draw event code is cut off. The last line is "case UP_LEFT: use_up_right = true; flip = true; break;", but it doesn't show the rest of the code where use_up_right is used.
Assuming that after the switch statement, there's code that uses use_up_right to determine the frame_offset, like in the initial solution I provided. So, probably, the error is occurring because the switch statement doesn't cover all possible cases, and for some directions, use_up_right is not being set.
Wait, looking back at the switch statement, it has cases for DOWN_RIGHT, UP_RIGHT, DOWN_LEFT, UP_LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, UP, and DOWN. These should cover all possible directions since there are 8 directions defined in the macros (RIGHT, UP, LEFT, DOWN, UP_RIGHT, UP_LEFT, DOWN_RIGHT, DOWN_LEFT).
But perhaps the throw_direction is not always one of these values. Wait, in the Step event, throw_direction is set to face, which should be one of the 8 directions. So, it should always hit one of the cases in the switch statement.
Wait, maybe the error is happening when action_state is not "throw", but somehow the code is trying to access use_up_right. But in the Draw event, the code is inside if (action_state == "throw"), so it should only execute when action_state is "throw".
Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo or a mistake in the variable name. Wait, in the error message, it says "<unknown_object>.use_up_right", which suggests that it's trying to access use_up_right as an instance variable, but in the code, it's a local variable defined within the Draw event.
Wait a minute, in GML, if you use a variable without declaring it with var, it becomes an instance variable. But in the code snippet, it shows "var use_up_right = false;", so it should be a local variable.
Wait, perhaps in the full code, the var declaration is missing or misplaced. Let me check the provided code again.
In the Draw event code you pasted, it starts with:
if (action_state == "throw") {

// Variables to determine animation and flip

var use_up_right = false; // False = "Throw Face Down Right", True = "Throw Face Up Right"

var flip = false;         // False = normal, True = flipped horizontally

So, yes, use_up_right is declared as a local variable with var, so it should be fine.
Wait, but the error message says "Variable <unknown_object>.use_up_right", which implies that it's trying to access use_up_right as if it were an instance variable, not a local variable.
This might happen if there's a scope issue, perhaps if the code after the switch statement is outside the if block or something. But from the snippet, it seems correct.
Alternatively, maybe there's another part of the Draw event that is trying to access use_up_right when action_state is not "throw".
Wait, perhaps the Draw event has multiple sections, and in another part, it's trying to use use_up_right without checking the action_state.
But in standard practice, the Draw event should handle drawing based on the current state, and variables should be properly scoped.
Another possibility is that there's a syntax error or a missing brace that causes the scop...(truncated 103347 characters)...action_state == "throw") {
    // ... (existing throw animation logic)
} else if (action_state != "none") {
    // ... (existing special action drawing logic)
} else {
    // Default drawing for walking or idle
    var frame_base = floor(image_index) * 24;
    var frame_x = frame_data[face][0] + frame_base;
    var frame_y = frame_data[face][1];
    draw_sprite_part(sprite_body, 0, frame_x, frame_y, 24, 24, x - 12, y - 12);
    draw_sprite_part_ext(sprite_color, 0, frame_x, frame_y, 24, 24, x - 12, y - 12, 1, 1, global.player_color, 1);
    draw_head_item();
}

### Explanation

- **Throw Animation Logic**: Determines the correct frame offset and flipping based on the throw direction. Uses `floor(action_timer / anim_speed)` to calculate the current frame, ensuring smooth animation progression.
- **Snowball Creation**: Moved to the Step event for precise timing, ensuring the snowball is created at the correct frame during the animation.
- **Special Actions**: Handled similarly, with animation timing managed in the Step event and drawing in the Draw event.
- **Default Drawing**: For walking or idle states, uses the standard frame calculation based on `image_index`.

This approach ensures that all drawing is handled in the Draw event, with the Step event managing the logic and timing. The throw animation should now display correctly without flickering or offset issues.

Let’s address your issue with the obj_player object in GameMaker, where the throw animation is flickering, flipped sprites are offset incorrectly, and you’re encountering an error about an undefined variable use_up_right in the Draw event. You’ve noted that drawing is happening in both the Step and Draw events, which is causing conflicts, and moving the Step event’s draw code to the Draw event worked better temporarily until the error occurred. I’ll consolidate all drawing logic into the Draw event, ensuring proper integration and resolving these issues.
Problem Analysis
Flickering: Drawing in both Step and Draw events causes the sprite to be rendered twice per frame, leading to visual conflicts (flickering). In GameMaker, drawing should occur exclusively in the Draw event for consistent rendering.

Offset Flipped Sprites: The Step event’s draw code worked well when moved, suggesting its logic for positioning and flipping is more reliable. The Draw event’s current setup may have incorrect offsets or flipping logic.

Error: use_up_right Not Set: The error Variable <unknown_object>.use_up_right not set before reading it at line 88 (var frame_offset = use_up_right ? 28 : 0;) indicates that use_up_right is accessed outside its intended scope or not always initialized. The provided Draw event code cuts off after the switch statement, but the error suggests that the variable’s declaration is either missing or scoped incorrectly in the full code.

Solution Approach
Move All Drawing to Draw Event: Eliminate drawing from the Step event (none is explicitly shown in your Step code, so it may be elsewhere or implied) and consolidate it into the Draw event.

Preserve Functional Logic: Use the Step event to manage animation timing and state (e.g., action_timer, throw_direction), while the Draw event handles rendering based on these states.

Fix Scope Issue: Ensure use_up_right and related variables are always defined within the Draw event’s throw block to prevent the error.

Correct Animation and Flipping: Integrate the throw animation logic with proper frame selection and sprite flipping, avoiding offsets and flickering.

Below, I’ll update the Step and Draw events for obj_player.
Updated Code
Step Event
The Step event should focus on logic: movement, input handling, action timing, and snowball creation. No drawing should occur here. Your provided Step event already avoids drawing, so I’ll refine it slightly for clarity and ensure it sets up the throw animation properly.

Notes:
Removed redundant debug messages and trimmed unrelated action logic for focus.

action_timer drives the throw animation, and the snowball spawns at snowball_release_frame (frame 15).

Draw Event
The Draw event will handle all rendering: throw animation, special actions, and default walking/idle states. I’ll integrate the throw logic from both events, ensuring use_up_right is properly scoped and the animation renders correctly.

Explanation
Step Event Changes
Throw Logic: Sets action_state, throw_direction, and action_timer. The snowball is created at frame 15 (snowball_release_frame), with offsets based on direction.

Timing: action_timer increments each step, driving the animation frame in the Draw event.

Draw Event Changes
Throw Animation:
Variables: use_up_right and flip are declared locally within the if (action_state == "throw") block, ensuring they’re always initialized before use, fixing the error.

Frame Calculation: Uses action_timer and anim_speed (0.5) to select the frame (0-27) from the throw animation array.

Sprite Sheet: Assumes spr_throwsnowball_body has “Throw Face Down Right” at y=0-72 and “Throw Face Up Right” at y=96-168 (adjust these offsets if your sprite sheet differs).

Flipping: Uses draw_sprite_part_ext with a scale of -1 for horizontal flipping when flip is true, centered at x - 12, y - 12.

Special Actions: Uses the existing action system, rendering based on action_timer and frame data.

Default Drawing: Handles walking/idle states using image_index from movement.

Fixes
Flickering: All drawing is now in the Draw event, preventing double rendering.

Offsets: Centered sprites at x - width/2, y - height/2 (or x - 12, y - 12 for 24x24 sprites), with flipping applied via scale.

Error: use_up_right is scoped correctly within the throw block, never accessed uninitialized.

Testing Notes
Sprite Sheet: Verify spr_throwsnowball_body and spr_throwsnowball_colour match the assumed layout (28 frames each for Down and Up animations, 24x24). Adjust frame_y += use_up_right ? 96 : 0 if the y-offset differs.

Animation Speed: anim_speed is 0.5 (2 steps per frame). Adjust in action_anim_speed if it’s too slow/fast.

Flipping: Test all directions to ensure flipped sprites align correctly.

This should resolve your issues with a clean, consolidated Draw event! Let me know if you need further tweaks.
