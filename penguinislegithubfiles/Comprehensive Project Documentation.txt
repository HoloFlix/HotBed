Introduction
Welcome to the developer documentation for the HoloFlix/HotBed project. This document aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the game's current build, key features, and areas for improvement. It will serve as a guide for developers working on the project, ensuring a smooth transition and consistent development practices.

Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories and files, each serving a specific purpose. The primary languages used in this project include:

JavaScript (38.6%)
Game Maker Language (GML) (36.5%)
CSS (13.6%)
Python (8.4%)
HTML (1.7%)
GLSL (1.2%)
Key Features
Skin Management
Files: obj_controller_create.txt, obj_controller_step.txt

Functionality:

Skin Initialization: Initializes available skins (global.skins) and sets the active skin (global.current_skin).
Dynamic Player Instance Creation: Creates player instances (obj_player, obj_player_icetruck, obj_player_tube) based on the active skin.
Skin Switching: The switch_skin(new_skin) function allows switching between skins while retaining player position, with debug logs for instance management.
Player Movement and Interaction
Files: obj_player_create.txt, obj_player_step.txt

Functionality:

Movement Variables: Initializes movement speed (xspd, yspd, move_spd) and advanced movement mechanisms such as sliding and driving.
NPC Interaction: Interacts with nearby NPCs using the "E" key, displaying random phrases and pausing NPC movement.
Skin Interaction: Allows players to switch skins when in close proximity using the "E" key.
UI Elements
Files: obj_skinpicker_create.txt, obj_chat_window_create.txt, obj_map_create.txt

Functionality:

Skin Picker: Generates buttons for available skins, centralizing the skin menu near the player or viewport center.
Chat Window: Manages the chat window state, initializing variables for dialog display and player choices.
Map: Sets the depth to ensure the map is drawn above all other objects.
Camera Management
Files: obj_camera_create.txt

Functionality:

Global Camera Initialization: Checks for an existing global camera and reattaches to it, or creates a new camera if none exists.
Camera Positioning: Updates the camera position to follow the player, clamped within room boundaries.
Macros Script
Files: scr_macros.txt

Functionality: Defines directional constants (RIGHT, UP, LEFT, DOWN, etc.) for consistent use throughout the codebase.

Warp and Slippery Mechanics
Files: obj_warp_create.txt, obj_slippery_step.txt

Functionality:

Warp: Initializes warp target room, position, and instance.
Sliding: Initializes sliding behavior, setting slide direction and speed based on movement speed.
NPC Creation
Files: obj_npc_create.txt

Functionality: Initializes NPC movement variables, sprite direction setup, and random initial direction with a timer to change direction every 2 seconds.

Bug Identification
Skin Picker (obj_skinpicker_create.txt):

Issue: Assumes player_instance is valid but doesn't handle cases where the player exists but is not at an accessible position.
Impact: Could lead to UI elements appearing outside the visible viewport.
NPC Animation (scr_npc_animate.txt):

Issue: Hardcoded frame delays and lack of configurable animation speeds.
Impact: Limits flexibility for dynamic NPC behaviors or varying animation speeds.
Camera Management:

Issue: Excessive debug messages, particularly for camera updates.
Impact: Can clutter logs, making it harder to identify critical issues.
Code Analysis and Optimization
Weak or Overlapping Code:

Skin Switching Logic:

Repeated logic in obj_controller_create and switch_skin(new_skin) for skin assignment.
Suggestion: Modularize the skin creation logic into a reusable function.
Duplicate Key Check Logic:

Both skin switching and NPC interaction use the "E" key (obj_player_step), which can result in unexpected overlaps.
Suggestion: Implement a priority or state-based system for key events to avoid conflicts.
Optimization Suggestions:

Refactor Skin Creation: Centralize the skin assignment logic into a single function to ensure maintainability and consistency.
Key Input Handling: Use a state manager to differentiate game states (e.g., interaction mode vs. exploration mode) and assign unique keys or contextual actions for overlapping interactions.
Functionality Understanding
Interactions:

Objects like obj_controller, obj_player, and obj_npc interact to form the core gameplay loop (movement, skin switching, and NPC interaction).
Gameplay Contribution:

The flexibility of dynamic skin switching enhances player customization.
NPC interactions create a responsive world, with randomized dialogues adding variety.
Recommendations for Improvement
Centralize Common Logic:

Extract redundant logic (e.g., skin switching) into reusable functions.
Ensure a clean and modular approach for easier debugging and updates.
Improve Key Event Handling:

Use a state manager to differentiate game states and avoid conflicts between NPC interaction and skin switching.
Assign unique keys or contextual actions for overlapping interactions.
Validate Instance Lifecycle:

Add checks to ensure global.player_instance is always managed properly during transitions.
Avoid memory leaks or invalid references by ensuring proper destruction and recreation.
Enhance NPC Behaviors:

Implement more dynamic and configurable NPC behaviors and dialogues for a richer gameplay experience.
UI Elements:

Ensure proper positioning and scaling of UI elements to avoid issues with different screen resolutions and aspect ratios.
Maintain consistency in the depth settings of UI elements to avoid layering issues.
Camera Management:

Clean up debug messages for a more streamlined log.
Test camera behavior in different room sizes and configurations to ensure smooth gameplay.
Best Practices
Code Modularity: Break down large functions into smaller, reusable ones to improve maintainability.
Consistent Naming Conventions: Use clear and consistent naming conventions for variables and functions.
