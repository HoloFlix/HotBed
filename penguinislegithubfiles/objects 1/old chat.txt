Let me know how you'd like to proceed or if there are specific areas you want to focus on based on the available data.

The projects main files are located in HotBed/Penguin Isles Project/ , All object files are located in their respected folders and contain the relevant event code; HotBed/Penguin Isles Project/objects
It seems there was an issue retrieving the project files from the specified directory. To proceed with the analysis, please ensure the files are accessible or provide further details on their location. If the files are in a different sub-directory or require specific access permissions, please let me know so I can assist you accordingly.

Are you able to systematically index my entire uploaded repository? I want a text file which contains all my repository index and folder structure for HotBed
To systematically index your entire uploaded repository and generate a text file containing the folder structure, you can use a Python script to traverse the directory structure and write it to a file. Below is a Python script that will achieve this:

Python
import os

# Define the path to the repository
repo_path = 'HotBed'

# The output file where the index will be written
output_file = 'repository_index.txt'

def index_repo(path, file):
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):
        level = root.replace(path, '').count(os.sep)
        indent = ' ' * 4 * (level)
        file.write(f'{indent}{os.path.basename(root)}/\n')
        sub_indent = ' ' * 4 * (level + 1)
        for f in files:
            file.write(f'{sub_indent}{f}\n')

# Create and write the index to the output file
with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
    index_repo(repo_path, f)

print(f'Repository index has been written to {output_file}')
Instructions to Run the Script:
Save the Script:
Save the above script as index_repo.py in your working directory.

Run the Script:
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing index_repo.py, and run the script using Python:

sh
python index_repo.py
Output:
The script will generate a text file named repository_index.txt in the same directory, containing the indexed folder structure of your HotBed repository.

This script uses the os.walk function to traverse the directory structure and write the folder names and file names with appropriate indentation to represent the hierarchy. You can modify the repo_path variable to point to the correct path of your repository if it's different from HotBed.

PLease adjust the script to search through this local directory; C:\Users\Shorty\GameMakerProjects\Penguin Isles Project
Certainly! Below is the adjusted Python script that will index the folder structure of the local directory C:\Users\Shorty\GameMakerProjects\Penguin Isles Project and write it to a text file.

Python
import os

# Define the path to the local directory
repo_path = 'C:\\Users\\Shorty\\GameMakerProjects\\Penguin Isles Project'

# The output file where the index will be written
output_file = 'repository_index.txt'

def index_repo(path, file):
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):
        level = root.replace(path, '').count(os.sep)
        indent = ' ' * 4 * (level)
        file.write(f'{indent}{os.path.basename(root)}/\n')
        sub_indent = ' ' * 4 * (level + 1)
        for f in files:
            file.write(f'{sub_indent}{f}\n')

# Create and write the index to the output file
with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
    index_repo(repo_path, f)

print(f'Repository index has been written to {output_file}')
Instructions to Run the Script:
Save the Script:
Save the above script as index_repo.py on your local machine.

Run the Script:
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing index_repo.py, and run the script using Python:

sh
python index_repo.py
Output:
The script will generate a text file named repository_index.txt in the same directory, containing the indexed folder structure of your Penguin Isles Project directory.

This script uses the os.walk function to traverse the directory structure and write the folder names and file names with appropriate indentation to represent the hierarchy. You can modify the repo_path variable to point to any other directory if needed.

Please review this index, Penguin Isles Project/repository_index.txt to better understand the locations of the essential code for you to read to write that report (Penguin Isles Project)
Based on the provided repository index, I can now proceed with analyzing the key features, code, and functionality of your GameMaker project files located in the Penguin Isles Project.

2. Bug Identification
No explicit bugs were identified in the provided code snippets. However, potential issues to watch for include:
Ensuring that all global variables are properly initialized and managed.
Handling edge cases where certain objects or instances may not exist.
3. Code Analysis
Weak or Overlapping Sections:

The depth setting for various objects (e.g., player, tube player, ice truck player) is identical and could potentially be consolidated into a common function or script.
Repetitive Code:

The initialization logic for player instances in different states (e.g., player, tube player, ice truck player) could be optimized by creating reusable functions or scripts.
4. Functionality Understanding
Game Functions and Elements:
The player object manages interactions with NPCs, movement, skin switching, and sliding behavior.
The tube player and ice truck player objects handle similar functionalities with slight variations in movement speed and behavior.
5. Recommendations for Improvement
Enhancing Code Efficiency and Gameplay:
Refactor repetitive code into separate scripts to enhance maintainability.
Ensure proper error handling and initialization of global variables.
Optimize event handling by ensuring that only necessary events are processed for each object.

Detailed Code Analysis and Recommendations
Based on the retrieved .gml files, here is a more in-depth review and recommendations for improvement:

1. obj_player/Create_0.gml
Code Analysis:

Initializes core variables for player movement and state.
Sets direction and sprite based on player movement.
Logs the initialization state for debugging.
Recommendations:

Consolidate Sprite Initialization:
The sprite initialization logic is repetitive. Consider creating a function to initialize sprites.

game
// Function to initialize sprites
function init_sprites() {
    sprite[RIGHT] = spr_player_right;
    sprite[UP] = spr_player_up;
    sprite[LEFT] = spr_player_left;
    sprite[DOWN] = spr_player_down;
    sprite[UP_RIGHT] = spr_player_up_right;
    sprite[UP_LEFT] = spr_player_up_left;
    sprite[DOWN_RIGHT] = spr_player_down_right;
    sprite[DOWN_LEFT] = spr_player_down_left;
}

// Call the function
init_sprites();
2. obj_player/Step_0.gml
Code Analysis:

Handles player interactions with NPCs and skin switching.
Manages movement input, sliding behavior, collisions, and animation.
Recommendations:

Refactor Collision Handling:
The collision handling logic is duplicated for both xspd and yspd. Consider creating a function to handle collisions.

game

Comprehensive Report on the HoloFlix/HotBed GameMaker Project
1. Key Features
Primary Features Implemented in the Game:

Global Variables and Initialization:

The game initializes various global variables for skins, player instances, and chat states.
Different player skins include "Player", "Ice Truck", and "Tube".
Player Movement and Interaction:

The player can move in multiple directions, interact with NPCs, and switch skins.
Movement involves handling input for up, down, left, and right directions, including sliding behavior on slippery surfaces.
NPC Behavior:

NPCs have predefined movement patterns, collision handling, and can engage in dialogue with the player.
NPCs can slide on slippery surfaces and change direction when colliding with walls.
Camera and Viewport Management:

The camera follows the player, ensuring the player is always centered in the view.
Smooth camera transitions are implemented to enhance visual experience.
Functionality of Each Object and Script:

obj_controller/Create_0.gml:

Initializes global variables for skins and player instances.
Ensures the player instance is created based on the current skin.
Logs the creation of the player instance for debugging.
game
global.skins = [
    { name: "Player", object: obj_player },
    { name: "Ice Truck", object: obj_player_icetruck },
    { name: "Tube", object: obj_player_tube }
];
global.current_skin = "player";
global.player_instance = noone;
obj_controller/Step_0.gml:

Defines a function to switch player skins.
Ensures the camera follows the current player instance.
game
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    ...
}

You can use this code to efficiently update your project. Let me know if you need further assistance with any specific part or another file.

Thank you,now can you provide the full event code for obj_controller/Create_0.gml but including the revised code changes "High Priority Implementation
Global Variable Initialization:

Review and Initialize Global Variables:

game
// obj_controller/Create_0.gml
if (global.player_instance == noone) {
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(x, y, "PlayerLayer", obj_player);
}
Ensure Proper Mapping of Current Skin:

game
// obj_controller/Create_0.gml
global.skins = [
    { name: "Player", object: obj_player },
    { name: "Ice Truck", object: obj_player_icetruck },
    { name: "Tube", object: obj_player_tube }
];
global.current_skin = "player";
global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(x, y, "PlayerLayer", obj_player);"
Sure! Here is the complete event code for obj_controller/Create_0.gml with the revised changes for high priority implementation:

game
// Create Event for obj_controller
// Initialize global variables
global.skins = [
    { name: "Player", object: obj_player },
    { name: "Ice Truck", object: obj_player_icetruck },

        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(x, y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
    } else if (global.current_skin == "tube") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(x, y, "Instances", obj_player_tube);
    }
}

// Debugging
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    show_debug_message("Player instance created: " + string(global.player_instance));
} else {
    show_debug_message("Error: Failed to create player instance.");
}

// Initialize move_spd from the player instance
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    move_spd = global.player_instance.move_spd;
}

// Initialize chat variables
global.chat_active = false;
global.chat_npc = noone;
This code ensures that global.player_instance is properly initialized and checks for its existence before creating the player instance based on the current skin. It also maps global.current_skin correctly to the global.skins array during initialization. Let me know if there is anything else you need!

Thank you, now can you provide detailed and easy to follow steps on how I add "Medium Priority Implementation
Refactor Sprite Initialization:

Create a Reusable Function:

game
// Common script for sprite initialization
function init_sprites(right, up, left, down) {
    sprite[RIGHT] = right;
    sprite[UP] = up;
    sprite[LEFT] = left;
    sprite[DOWN] = down;
}
Use the Function in Create Events:

game
// obj_player/Create_0.gml
init_sprites(spr_player_right, spr_player_up, spr_player_left, spr_player_down);
Optimize Collision Handling:

Consolidate Collision Logic:

game
// Common script for collision handling
function handle_collision(axis, speed) {
    var offset = (axis == "x") ? [speed, 0] : [0, speed];
    if (place_meeting(x + offset[0], y + offset[1], obj_wall)) {
        return 0;
    }
    return speed;
}
Use the Function in Step Events:

game
// obj_player/Step_0.gml
xspd = handle_collision("x", xspd);
yspd = handle_collision("y", yspd);" I want to the full event code for each object, So I can easily and efficently add the revised code to my project
Detailed Steps to Implement Medium Priority Changes
1. Refactor Sprite Initialization
Step 1: Create a Reusable Function

1.1. Create a new script file (e.g., scr_init_sprites.gml) in your GameMaker project.

1.2. Add the following code to the script:

game
// scr_init_sprites.gml

/// @function init_sprites
/// @param right - sprite for facing right
/// @param up - sprite for facing up
/// @param left - sprite for facing left
/// @param down - sprite for facing down
function init_sprites(right, up, left, down) {
    sprite[RIGHT] = right;
    sprite[UP] = up;
    sprite[LEFT] = left;
    sprite[DOWN] = down;
}
Step 2: Use the Function in Create Events

2.1. Open the obj_player/Create_0.gml file.

2.2. Replace the sprite initialization code with a call to the new init_sprites function:

game
// Create Event for obj_player

// Core variables
xspd = 0;
yspd = 0;
move_spd = 2;

// Sliding variables
sliding = false;
slide_dir_x = 0;
slide_dir_y = 0;
slide_speed = 0;

// Driving variables
driving = false;
ice_truck_sprite = spr_icetruck_facedown;
original_sprite = sprite_index;

// Set direction and sprites
face = DOWN;
init_sprites(spr_player_right, spr_player_up, spr_player_left, spr_player_down);

// Debugging
show_debug_message("obj_player: Initialized. Driving state: " + string(driving));
2. Optimize Collision Handling
Step 3: Create a Reusable Collision Handling Function

3.1. Create a new script file (e.g., scr_handle_collision.gml) in your GameMaker project.

3.2. Add the following code to the script:

game
// scr_handle_collision.gml

/// @function handle_collision
/// @param axis - the axis to check ("x" or "y")
/// @param speed - the speed to check for collision
/// @returns the adjusted speed if a collision is detected, otherwise the original speed
function handle_collision(axis, speed) {
    var offset = (axis == "x") ? [speed, 0] : [0, speed];
    if (place_meeting(x + offset[0], y + offset[1], obj_wall)) {
        return 0;
    }
    return speed;
}
Step 4: Use the Function in Step Events

4.1. Open the obj_player/Step_0.gml file.

4.2. Replace the collision handling code with calls to the new handle_collision function:

game
// Handle interaction with NPC
if (keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {
    var target_npc = instance_nearest(x, y, obj_npc); // Find the nearest NPC
    if (target_npc != noone && distance_to_object(target_npc) < 48) { // Check proximity
        target_npc.current_phrase = target_npc.phrases[irandom_range(0, array_length(target_npc.phrases) - 1)]; // Pick a random phrase
        target_npc.talk_timer = fps * 3; // Show the phrase for 3 seconds
        target_npc.interact_pause = fps * 3; // Pause NPC movement for 3 seconds
        show_debug_message("Player interacted with NPC. NPC says: " + target_npc.current_phrase);
    }
}

// Handle skin switching
if (keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {
    if (distance_to_object(obj_icetruck) < 32) {
        show_debug_message("E key pressed");
        obj_controller.switch_skin(global.current_skin == "player" ? "icetruck" : "player");
    }
}

// Handle skin switching
if (keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {
    if (distance_to_object(obj_tube) < 32) {
        show_debug_message("E key pressed");
        obj_controller.switch_skin(global.current_skin == "player" ? "tube" : "player");
    }
}

// Handle movement input
var right_key = keyboard_check(ord("D")) || keyboard_check(vk_right);
var left_key = keyboard_check(ord("A")) || keyboard_check(vk_left);
var up_key = keyboard_check(ord("W")) || keyboard_check(vk_up);
var down_key = keyboard_check(ord("S")) || keyboard_check(vk_down);

// Get xspd & yspd
if (!sliding) {
    xspd = (right_key - left_key) * move_spd;
    yspd = (down_key - up_key) * move_spd;
} else {
    // Continue sliding
    xspd = slide_dir_x * slide_speed;
    yspd = slide_dir_y * slide_speed;

    // Decelerate slide over time
    slide_speed *= 0.98; // Adjust this value to control sliding deceleration

    // Stop sliding if speed is low enough
    if (abs(slide_speed) < 0.1) {
        sliding = false;
        xspd = 0;
        yspd = 0;
    }
}

// Pause
if (instance_exists(obj_pauser)) {
    xspd = 0;
    yspd = 0;
}

// Set sprite
mask_index = sprite[DOWN];
if (yspd < 0) {
    if (xspd < 0) { face = UP_LEFT; }
    else if (xspd > 0) { face = UP_RIGHT; }
    else { face = UP; }
} else if (yspd > 0) {
    if (xspd < 0) { face = DOWN_LEFT; }
    else if (xspd > 0) { face = DOWN_RIGHT; }
    else { face = DOWN; }
} else {
    if (xspd > 0) { face = RIGHT; }
    else if (xspd < 0) { face = LEFT; }
}

sprite_index = sprite[face];

// Collisions
xspd = handle_collision("x", xspd);
yspd = handle_collision("y", yspd);

// Move the player
x += xspd;
y += yspd;

// Animate
if (xspd == 0 && yspd == 0) {
    image_index = 0;
}

// Depth
depth = -bbox_bottom;
Summary
Refactor Sprite Initialization: Created a reusable function init_sprites and used it in obj_player/Create_0.gml.
Optimize Collision Handling: Created a reusable function handle_collision and used it in obj_player/Step_0.gml.
These changes will help to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability. Let me know if you need any further assistance!

I originally had 8 directions for the players sprite (sprite[RIGHT] = spr_player_right;
sprite[UP] = spr_player_up;
sprite[LEFT] = spr_player_left;
sprite[DOWN] = spr_player_down;
sprite[UP_RIGHT] = spr_player_up_right;
sprite[UP_LEFT] = spr_player_up_left;
sprite[DOWN_RIGHT] = spr_player_down_right;
sprite[DOWN_LEFT] = spr_player_down_left;) can you revise the sprite script and player create event code to include them all?
Certainly! Let's revise the sprite initialization function and update the obj_player/Create_0.gml to include all 8 directions for the player's sprite.

Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Create the Reusable Sprite Initialization Function
1.1. Create a new script file (e.g., scr_init_sprites.gml) in your GameMaker project.

1.2. Add the following code to the script:

game
// scr_init_sprites.gml

/// @function init_sprites
/// @param right - sprite for facing right
/// @param up - sprite for facing up
/// @param left - sprite for facing left
/// @param down - sprite for facing down
/// @param up_right - sprite for facing up-right
/// @param up_left - sprite for facing up-left
/// @param down_right - sprite for facing down-right
/// @param down_left - sprite for facing down-left
function init_sprites(right, up, left, down, up_right, up_left, down_right, down_left) {
    sprite[RIGHT] = right;
    sprite[UP] = up;
    sprite[LEFT] = left;
    sprite[DOWN] = down;
    sprite[UP_RIGHT] = up_right;
    sprite[UP_LEFT] = up_left;
    sprite[DOWN_RIGHT] = down_right;
    sprite[DOWN_LEFT] = down_left;
}
2. Use the Function in obj_player/Create_0.gml
2.1. Open the obj_player/Create_0.gml file.

2.2. Replace the sprite initialization code with a call to the new init_sprites function:

game
// Create Event for obj_player

// Core variables
xspd = 0;
yspd = 0;
move_spd = 2;

// Sliding variables
sliding = false;
slide_dir_x = 0;
slide_dir_y = 0;
slide_speed = 0;

// Driving variables
driving = false;
ice_truck_sprite = spr_icetruck_facedown;
original_sprite = sprite_index;

// Set direction and sprites
face = DOWN;
init_sprites(spr_player_right, spr_player_up, spr_player_left, spr_player_down, spr_player_up_right, spr_player_up_left, spr_player_down_right, spr_player_down_left);

// Debugging
show_debug_message("obj_player: Initialized. Driving state: " + string(driving));
Summary
Reusable Function: Created a reusable function init_sprites to initialize all 8 direction sprites.
Updated Create Event: Modified obj_player/Create_0.gml to use the init_sprites function, ensuring all 8 directions are included.
This refactoring helps to reduce code duplication and makes the sprite initialization process more maintainable and scalable. Let me know if you need any further assistance!

Detailed Instructions for Low Priority Implementation
1. Add Comments and Documentation
Step 1: Document Functions and Interactions

1.1. Open the obj_controller/Step_0.gml file.

1.2. Add comments and documentation to the switch_skin function:

game
/// Function: switch_skin
/// Description: Switches the player's skin to the specified skin.
/// Parameters: new_skin (string) - The name of the skin to switch to.
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x, player_y;

    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        player_x = global.player_instance.x;
        player_y = global.player_instance.y;
        instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    } else {
        // Fallback in case global.player_instance doesn't exist
        player_x = room_width / 2;
        player_y = room_height / 2;
        show_debug_message("Warning: global.player_instance was invalid, defaulting position to room center.");
    }

    if (new_skin == "icetruck") {

        }

        show_debug_message("Switched to player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    }
}
2. Enhance Camera Transitions
Step 2: Implement Additional Effects

2.1. Add a new script file (e.g., scr_camera_easing.gml) with the easing function:

game
/// Easing function for smooth camera transitions
function easing_out_quad(t) {
    return t * (2 - t);
}
2.2. Update the camera transition code in obj_controller/Step_0.gml:

game
// Ensure the viewport follows the current player instance
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    var target_x = global.player_instance.x - (camera_get_view_width(global.camera) / 2);
    var target_y = global.player_instance.y - (camera_get_view_height(global.camera) / 2);

    target_x = clamp(target_x, 0, room_width - camera_get_view_width(global.camera));
    target_y = clamp(target_y, 0, room_height - camera_get_view_height(global.camera));

    var smooth_x = lerp(camera_get_view_x(global.camera), target_x, 0.1);
    var smooth_y = lerp(camera_get_view_y(global.camera), target_y, 0.1);

    // Use easing function for smoother transitions
    var eased_smooth_x = easing_out_quad(smooth_x);
    var eased_smooth_y = easing_out_quad(smooth_y);

    camera_set_view_pos(global.camera, eased_smooth_x, eased_smooth_y);
}

After updating the camera code when the game begins the screen is all black and the players viewport camera very rapidly moves down when the player walks up and when the players walks down and camera moves way to far up. This is happening both vertically and horizontaly. When the player moves left the camera moves right. I think the new camera easing script needs to be adjusted 
It sounds like the easing function might be causing the camera to misbehave. We can adjust the camera transition code to ensure it functions correctly. Let's take a step-by-step approach to identify and fix the issue.

Steps to Adjust the Camera Easing
Review the Easing Function:

Ensure the easing function is returning values in the correct range and fashion.
Simplify the Camera Transition Logic:

Make sure the camera smoothly follows the player without overshooting or oscillating.
Adjusted Code
Let's start by simplifying the camera transition logic. We'll use linear interpolation (lerp) for smooth transitions and ensure the target positions are clamped correctly.

Updated Camera Transition Code in obj_controller/Step_0.gml:

game
// Ensure the viewport follows the current player instance
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    var target_x = global.player_instance.x - (camera_get_view_width(global.camera) / 2);
    var target_y = global.player_instance.y - (camera_get_view_height(global.camera) / 2);

    // Clamp the target positions to ensure the camera doesn't go out of bounds
    target_x = clamp(target_x, 0, room_width - camera_get_view_width(global.camera));
    target_y = clamp(target_y, 0, room_height - camera_get_view_height(global.camera));

    // Use linear interpolation for smooth transitions
    var smooth_x = lerp(camera_get_view_x(global.camera), target_x, 0.1);
    var smooth_y = lerp(camera_get_view_y(global.camera), target_y, 0.1);

    // Update the camera position
    camera_set_view_pos(global.camera, smooth_x, smooth_y);
}

// Update in obj_controller_step
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    view_object[0] = global.player_instance;  // Set the viewport to track the player
}

show_debug_message("Viewport object: " + string(view_object[0]));
Explanation
Clamping Target Positions: The clamp function ensures that the target positions for the camera are within the room boundaries.
Linear Interpolation: The lerp function is used to smoothly transition the camera towards the target position. The factor 0.1 controls the smoothness (you can adjust this value to make the transition faster or slower).
Testing
After updating the camera code, please test the following scenarios:

Player Movement: Move the player in all directions (up, down, left, right) and ensure the camera follows smoothly.
Room Boundaries: Ensure the camera does not move out of the room boundaries and correctly clamps at the edges.
If the issue persists, we may need to further adjust the interpolation factor or review the camera initialization settings. Let me know if you need further adjustments or assistance!

That fixed it. Awesome now the project has be optimized and the new code has successfully been implemented into the project. Ive noticed a bug that occurs when the players moves to a different room after picking either the ice truck or tube skins from the picker. Ive updated the output log for your review at penguinislegithubfiles/debugoutput1.txt. You should see that when the player moved to a different room when 'driving' an icetruck that was spawned into the room the room transition occurs correctly, however once the ice truck skin has been picked from the skin picker the game crashes when the player moves to a different room. What do you think is causing this and how would you troubleshoot and debug the issue?
Troubleshooting and Debugging Steps
From the debug output, we can see that the game crashes when switching to the ice truck skin and transitioning to a new room. Let's systematically identify and fix the issue.

1. Check the Initialization of the Player Instance
Ensure that the player instance is correctly initialized and exists in the new room. This includes setting the correct skin and ensuring the instance is correctly created.

2. Verify Player Instance Persistence Across Rooms
Ensure that the player instance persists across rooms and is not destroyed or incorrectly referenced during the transition. This might involve checking the switch_skin function and room transition logic.

Steps to Debug
Review the switch_skin Function:
Ensure that the switch_skin function correctly handles the player instance and initializes it properly.

Check Room Transition Logic:
Ensure that the player instance is correctly carried over to the new room and re-initialized if necessary.

Add Debugging Information:
Add more debug messages to track the state of the player instance and the current skin during room transitions.

Updated Code
1. Enhanced switch_skin Function
Add detailed debug messages and ensure the correct initialization of the player instance.

game
/// Function: switch_skin
/// Description: Switches the player's skin to the specified skin.
/// Parameters: new_skin (string) - The name of the skin to switch to.
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x, player_y;

    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        player_x = global.player_instance.x;
        player_y = global.player_instance.y;
        instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    } else {
        // Fallback in case global.player_instance doesn't exist
        player_x = room_width / 2;
        player_y = room_height / 2;
        show_debug_message("Warning: global.player_instance was invalid, defaulting position to room center.");
    }

    if (new_skin == "icetruck") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
        global.current_skin = "icetruck";
        show_debug_message("Switched to icetruck. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    } 
    else if (new_skin == "tube") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_tube);
        global.current_skin = "tube";
        show_debug_message("Switched to tube. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    } 
    else if (new_skin == "player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
        global.current_skin = "player";
        show_debug_message("Switched to player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));

        // Destroy tube or icetruck objects nearby if they exist
        var ice_truck = instance_place(player_x, player_y, obj_icetruck);
        if (ice_truck != noone) {
            instance_destroy(ice_truck);
        }
        var tube = instance_place(player_x, player_y, obj_tube);
        if (tube != noone) {
            instance_destroy(tube);
        }

        show_debug_message("Switched to player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    }
}
2. Enhanced Room Transition Logic
Ensure the player instance is correctly set up in the new room and add more debug messages.

game
// Ensure the viewport follows the current player instance
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    var target_x = global.player_instance.x - (camera_get_view_width(global.camera) / 2);
    var target_y = global.player_instance.y - (camera_get_view_height(global.camera) / 2);

    // Clamp the target positions to ensure the camera doesn't go out of bounds
    target_x = clamp(target_x, 0, room_width - camera_get_view_width(global.camera));
    target_y = clamp(target_y, 0, room_height - camera_get_view_height(global.camera));

    // Use linear interpolation for smooth transitions
    var smooth_x = lerp(camera_get_view_x(global.camera), target_x, 0.1);
    var smooth_y = lerp(camera_get_view_y(global.camera), target_y, 0.1);

    // Update the camera position
    camera_set_view_pos(global.camera, smooth_x, smooth_y);

    show_debug_message("Camera position updated: (" + string(smooth_x) + ", " + string(smooth_y) + ")");
} else {
    show_debug_message("Error: Player instance not found during camera update.");
}

// Update in obj_controller_step
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    view_object[0] = global.player_instance;  // Set the viewport to track the player
} else {
    show_debug_message("Error: Player instance not found during viewport update.");
}

show_debug_message("Viewport object: " + string(view_object[0]));
Testing and Verification
Run the Game:

Switch to the ice truck skin and transition to a new room.
Monitor the debug output for messages related to the player instance and camera position.
Check for Errors:

Ensure no errors or crashes occur during the room transition.
Verify that the player instance is correctly initialized and the camera follows the player smoothly.
Adjust as Needed:

If issues persist, further adjust the debug messages and logic to pinpoint the issue.
By following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the issue causing the game to crash when transitioning rooms with the ice truck skin. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Ive added your code and also ran another test; Ive provided an updated output log your your review penguinislegithubfiles/debugoutput1.txt, the error makes reference to obj_war_block whose event code should be found in here Penguin Isles Project/objects/obj_warp_block, and Penguin Isles Project/objects/obj_warp
The debug output and event code for obj_warp_block and obj_warp suggest that the game crashes during room transitions when the player is using the ice truck or tube skins. Here are the steps to troubleshoot and debug the issue:

Steps to Troubleshoot and Debug
Review the Room Transition Logic:

Ensure that the player instance is correctly moved to the new room.
Verify that all necessary properties and states are maintained during the transition.
Check for Missing or Incorrect References:

Ensure that the target_instance is correctly assigned and referenced.
Verify that the player instance is not destroyed or misreferenced during the transition.
Add Detailed Debugging Information:

Add more debug messages to track the state of the player instance and the target instance during room transitions.
Updated Code
1. Enhanced Room Transition Logic in obj_warp_block
Add detailed debug messages and ensure the correct initialization and assignment of the target_instance.

game
// Create Event for obj_warp_block
target_rm = 0;
target_x = 0;
target_y = 0;
target_face = 0;
target_instance = noone; // Track the instance to move

// Debugging
show_debug_message("obj_warp_block: Initialized. Target room: " + string(target_rm));
show_debug_message("Target position: (" + string(target_x) + ", " + string(target_y) + ")");
show_debug_message("Target face: " + string(target_face));
show_debug_message("Target instance: " + string(target_instance));
2. Enhanced Room Transition Logic in obj_warp
Add detailed debug messages and ensure the correct initialization and assignment of the target_instance.

game
// Create Event for obj_warp
target_rm = 0;
target_x = 0;
target_y = 0;
target_face = 0;
target_instance = noone; // Track the instance to move

// Debugging
show_debug_message("obj_warp: Initialized. Target room: " + string(target_rm));
show_debug_message("Target position: (" + string(target_x) + ", " + string(target_y) + ")");
show_debug_message("Target face: " + string(target_face));
show_debug_message("Target instance: " + string(target_instance));
3. Room Transition Handling in Player Object
Ensure the player instance is correctly handled during room transitions:

game
// obj_player/Step Event or appropriate event for handling room transitions

if (place_meeting(x, y, obj_warp_block)) {
    var warp_block = instance_place(x, y, obj_warp_block);
    if (warp_block != noone) {
        var target_room = warp_block.target_rm;
        var target_x = warp_block.target_x;
        var target_y = warp_block.target_y;
        var target_face = warp_block.target_face;

        // Debugging
        show_debug_message("Warping to room: " + string(target_room) + " at position: (" + string(target_x) + ", " + string(target_y) + ")");
        show_debug_message("Player instance ID before warp: " + string(global.player_instance));

        room_goto(target_room);

        // Update player position and face direction after room transition
        x = target_x;
        y = target_y;
        face = target_face;

        // Debugging
        show_debug_message("Player instance ID after warp: " + string(global.player_instance));
        show_debug_message("Player position after warp: (" + string(x) + ", " + string(y) + ")");
    }
}
Testing and Verification
Run the Game:

Switch to the ice truck or tube skin and transition to a new room.
Monitor the debug output for messages related to the player instance, target instance, and room transition.
Check for Errors:

Ensure no errors or crashes occur during the room transition.
Verify that the player instance is correctly initialized and placed in the new room.
Adjust as Needed:

If issues persist, further adjust the debug messages and logic to pinpoint the issue.
By following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the issue causing the game to crash when transitioning rooms with the ice truck or tube skin. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Your code didnt work, the game still crashed when the player moves to a different room once they have changed their skin with the skinpicker. It also made it so the player would spawn where the controller started the program in every room instead of following the individual creation code for each warp_block object. Ive decided to remove that addition to the code. I want to focus on implementing a simple mini game into my project. It will work like this; when the player collides with a warp block object in a specific room they will be moved to the room where the mini game is contained. I want the game to work in a similar way to Club Penguins Sled Racing Mini Game ( I have provided the original mini games source files here Club_Penguin_Minigames-master/SledRacing/) although slightly updated and revised to better suit my game/project. The players sprite should be changed when the minigame starts to spr_tube_player_down and their movement should be completely different to the player, icetruck and tube objects. The player should be almost locked to the top part of the camera viewport, can only move left, right, up and down except their sprite with stay as spr_tube_player_down. They rooms background or tile floor sprite should be moving upwards from the perspective of the players viewport to give off the effect of the player moving down without actually doing so. obsactles will be drawn into the room and moved from the bottom to the top and the players goal is to avoid the obstacles and make it to the bottom of the mountain with out hitting anything. They will have three lives. Please review the original sled racing minigame so you can understand the vision and end goal. Then please write up a report detailing your findings and outlining step by step instructions on how youd being working on this minigame and adding it to HotBed/Penguin Isles Project/
It seems I can't access the specific mini-game source files directly. However, I can provide a detailed plan on how to implement the mini-game based on your description and the general concept of Club Penguin's Sled Racing Mini Game.

Detailed Plan and Step-by-Step Instructions
Overview of the Mini-Game
Objective: The player must avoid obstacles while "sledding" down a hill.
Player Control: The player can move left, right, up, and down, but their sprite remains the same.
Environment: The background or tile floor sprite moves upwards to simulate the player moving downwards.
Obstacles: Obstacles appear from the bottom of the screen and move upwards. The player must avoid them.
Lives: The player has three lives. If they hit an obstacle, they lose a life. If they lose all lives, the mini-game ends.
Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Set Up the Room for the Mini-Game
1.1. Create a New Room:

Create a new room in your project (e.g., rm_sled_racing).
1.2. Set the Background:

Set the background or tile floor sprite to move upwards to simulate the sledding effect.
2. Create the Player Object for the Mini-Game
2.1. Create a New Object:

Create a new object for the player in the mini-game (e.g., obj_sled_player).
2.2. Set the Sprite:

Set the sprite to spr_tube_player_down.
2.3. Add Movement Code:

Add code to handle movement (left, right, up, down) while keeping the player locked to the top part of the camera viewport.
game
// Create Event for obj_sled_player
xspd = 0;
yspd = 0;
move_spd = 4;
lives = 3;

// Step Event for obj_sled_player
xspd = 0;
yspd = 0;
if (keyboard_check(vk_left)) xspd = -move_spd;
if (keyboard_check(vk_right)) xspd = move_spd;
if (keyboard_check(vk_up)) yspd = -move_spd;
if (keyboard_check(vk_down)) yspd = move_spd;

x += xspd;
y += yspd;

// Keep the player locked to the top part of the viewport
y = clamp(y, 0, room_height / 4);

// Check for collisions with obstacles
if (place_meeting(x, y, obj_obstacle)) {
    lives -= 1;
    if (lives <= 0) {
        show_message("Game Over");
        // Add code to end the mini-game and return to the main game
    }
}
3. Create Obstacles
3.1. Create a New Object:

Create a new object for obstacles (e.g., obj_obstacle).
3.2. Add Movement Code:

Add code to move obstacles from the bottom to the top of the screen.
game
// Create Event for obj_obstacle
vspd = -4; // Speed at which obstacles move upwards

// Step Event for obj_obstacle
y += vspd;

// Destroy the obstacle if it goes off the top of the screen
if (y < -sprite_height) {
    instance_destroy();
}
4. Spawn Obstacles
4.1. Create a Controller Object:

Create a new object to handle spawning obstacles (e.g., obj_obstacle_controller).
4.2. Add Code to Spawn Obstacles:

Add code to spawn obstacles at random intervals and positions.
game
// Create Event for obj_obstacle_controller
alarm[0] = 30; // Spawn an obstacle every 30 steps

// Alarm[0] Event for obj_obstacle_controller
instance_create_layer(random(room_width), room_height, "Instances", obj_obstacle);
alarm[0] = 30; // Reset the alarm
5. Handle Room Transitions
5.1. Warp Block Collision:

Add code to handle the transition to the mini-game room when the player collides with a warp block.
game
// Collision Event with obj_warp_block
if (other.target_rm == rm_sled_racing) {
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(other.target_x, other.target_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
    room_goto(other.target_rm);
}
Summary
Set Up the Room: Created a new room (rm_sled_racing) with a moving background.
Player Object: Created obj_sled_player with movement and collision handling.
Obstacles: Created obj_obstacle and obj_obstacle_controller to handle obstacle spawning and movement.
Room Transitions: Added code to transition to the mini-game room when colliding with a warp block.

Thank you for that breif intro, I have created the room and also created the new objects and sprites. I want further clarification regarding the rooms intended width and height, and wether the viewport is enabled and what diemensions the camera and veiwport properties are meant to be. Please also remind me regarding any other niche details that are essential that I may have forgotten.
Great to hear that you've made progress! Let's clarify the room dimensions, viewport, and camera properties for the sled racing mini-game, along with other essential details.

Room Dimensions
Width and Height:

Width: 800 pixels (You can adjust this based on your game's design and screen size).
Height: 600 pixels (Adjustable as needed).
Viewport and Camera Properties
Viewport:

Enable the viewport for the room.
Viewport Width: 800 pixels
Viewport Height: 600 pixels
Viewport X: 0 pixels
Viewport Y: 0 pixels
Camera:

Enable the camera for the room.
Camera Width: 800 pixels
Camera Height: 600 pixels
Camera X: 0 pixels
Camera Y: 0 pixels
Setting Up the Room in GameMaker
Room Properties:

Set the room width to 800 pixels and height to 600 pixels.
Viewport and Camera:

Enable the viewport.
Set the viewport properties (width and height to 800x600, X and Y to 0).
Enable the camera.
Set the camera properties (width and height to 800x600, X and Y to 0).
Additional Essential Details
Player Initialization:

Ensure the player is initialized correctly in the mini-game room.
The player should be positioned near the top of the room to give the effect of moving downwards.
Obstacle Movement:

Obstacles should move from the bottom to the top of the room to create the illusion of the player moving down the hill.
Lives and Collision:

Initialize the player's lives (e.g., 3 lives).
Implement collision detection with obstacles to decrement lives.
End the mini-game when the player loses all lives.
Background Movement:

Implement a moving background to simulate the downward movement. You can achieve this by moving the background texture upwards.
Debugging and Testing:

Add debug messages to track the player's position, lives, and collisions.
Test the mini-game thoroughly to ensure smooth transitions and correct implementation.
Example Code for Initialization and Movement
game
// Create Event for obj_sled_player
xspd = 0;
yspd = 0;
move_spd = 4;
lives = 3;

// Step Event for obj_sled_player
xspd = 0;
yspd = 0;
if (keyboard_check(vk_left)) xspd = -move_spd;
if (keyboard_check(vk_right)) xspd = move_spd;
if (keyboard_check(vk_up)) yspd = -move_spd;
if (keyboard_check(vk_down)) yspd = move_spd;

x += xspd;
y += yspd;

// Keep the player locked to the top part of the viewport
y = clamp(y, 0, room_height / 4);

// Check for collisions with obstacles
if (place_meeting(x, y, obj_obstacle)) {
    lives -= 1;
    if (lives <= 0) {
        show_message("Game Over");
        // Add code to end the mini-game and return to the main game
    }
}

// Create Event for obj_obstacle
vspd = -4; // Speed at which obstacles move upwards

// Step Event for obj_obstacle
y += vspd;

// Destroy the obstacle if it goes off the top of the screen
if (y < -sprite_height) {
    instance_destroy();
}

// Create Event for obj_obstacle_controller
alarm[0] = 30; // Spawn an obstacle every 30 steps

// Alarm[0] Event for obj_obstacle_controller
instance_create_layer(random(room_width), room_height, "Instances", obj_obstacle);
alarm[0] = 30; // Reset the alarm

// Collision Event with obj_warp_block
if (other.target_rm == rm_sled_racing) {
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(other.target_x, other.target_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
    room_goto(other.target_rm);
}
Summary
Room Dimensions: Width of 800 pixels and height of 600 pixels.
Viewport and Camera: Enabled with dimensions 800x600 pixels.
Player Initialization: Set up near the top of the room.
Obstacle Movement: Move obstacles from bottom to top.
Lives and Collision: Initialize lives and handle collisions.
Background Movement: Implement a moving background.
Debugging and Testing: Add debug messages and test thoroughly.
By following these guidelines, you should have a well-structured mini-game that fits within your project. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

This is my current creation code for a specific obj warp block in a certain room (target_rm = rm_sled_racing;
target_x = 55;
target_y = 235;
target_face = DOWN;) how do I better incorperate the skin switching system to automatically set the players skin the obj_sled_player for the minigame?
To incorporate the skin-switching system with the warp block so that the player's skin is automatically set to obj_sled_player for the mini-game, you can update the collision event handling of the warp block to include the skin switching logic. Here's how you can achieve this:

Ensure the creation code for the warp block includes the target room and position.
game
// Creation Code for a specific obj_warp_block in a certain room
target_rm = rm_sled_racing;
target_x = 55;
target_y = 235;
target_face = DOWN;
Update the Collision Event Handling:
Modify the collision event in the warp block to switch the player's skin to obj_sled_player when entering the mini-game room.
Updated Collision Event Code
game
// Collision Event with obj_warp_block
if (other.target_rm == rm_sled_racing) {
    // Switch the player skin to obj_sled_player
    switch_skin("sled_player");

    // Move the player to the target room and position
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(target_x, target_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
    room_goto(target_rm);
}
Updated switch_skin Function
Ensure the switch_skin function includes the logic for switching to the obj_sled_player skin.

game
/// Function: switch_skin
/// Description: Switches the player's skin to the specified skin.
/// Parameters: new_skin (string) - The name of the skin to switch to.
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x, player_y;

    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        player_x = global.player_instance.x;
        player_y = global.player_instance.y;
        instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    } else {
        // Fallback in case global.player_instance doesn't exist
        player_x = room_width / 2;
        player_y = room_height / 2;
        show_debug_message("Warning: global.player_instance was invalid, defaulting position to room center.");
    }

    if (new_skin == "icetruck") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
        global.current_skin = "icetruck";
        show_debug_message("Switched to icetruck. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    } 
    else if (new_skin == "tube") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_tube);
        global.current_skin = "tube";
        show_debug_message("Switched to tube. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    } 
    else if (new_skin == "player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
        global.current_skin = "player";
        show_debug_message("Switched to player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    }
    else if (new_skin == "sled_player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
        global.current_skin = "sled_player";
        show_debug_message("Switched to sled_player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    }
}
Summary
Creation Code: Ensure the warp block's creation code includes the target room and position.
Collision Event: Update the collision event to switch the player's skin to obj_sled_player and move the player to the target room and position.
Switch Skin Function: Ensure the switch_skin function includes logic for switching to the obj_sled_player skin.
By following these steps, you can ensure that the player's skin is automatically switched to obj_sled_player when they collide with the warp block and enter the mini-game room. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Could you show me with the full event code where I put the updated collision event code? I also got this error (############################################################################################
ERROR in action number 1
of Create Event for object obj_sled_player:
Variable obj_sled_player.target_rm(100014, -2147483648) not set before reading it.
 at gml_Object_obj_sled_player_Create_0 (line 49) - if (other.target_rm == rm_sled_racing) {
############################################################################################
gml_Object_obj_sled_player_Create_0 (line 49))
Let's address the error and integrate the updated collision event code into your project.

Error Explanation and Fix
The error message indicates that the variable target_rm is not set before being read in the Create event of obj_sled_player. This suggests that the collision event code is misplaced or that target_rm is not properly initialized.

Correct Placement of Collision Event Code
The collision event code should be placed in the warp block object (obj_warp_block) and not in obj_sled_player. The warp block should handle the transition to the sled racing mini-game and switch the player's skin accordingly.

Full Event Code for obj_warp_block
Here is the full event code for the warp block object, including the updated collision event:

game
// Creation Code for obj_warp_block
target_rm = rm_sled_racing;
target_x = 55;
target_y = 235;
target_face = DOWN;

// Collision Event with obj_player
if (other != noone && other.object_index == obj_player) {
    // Check if the target room is the sled racing mini-game room
    if (target_rm == rm_sled_racing) {
        // Switch the player's skin to obj_sled_player
        switch_skin("sled_player");

        // Move the player to the target room and position
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(target_x, target_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
        room_goto(target_rm);
    }
}

// switch_skin Function
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x, player_y;

    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        player_x = global.player_instance.x;
        player_y = global.player_instance.y;
        instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    } else {
        // Fallback in case global.player_instance doesn't exist
        player_x = room_width / 2;
        player_y = room_height / 2;
        show_debug_message("Warning: global.player_instance was invalid, defaulting position to room center.");
    }

    if (new_skin == "icetruck") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
        global.current_skin = "icetruck";
        show_debug_message("Switched to icetruck. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    } 
    else if (new_skin == "tube") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_tube);
        global.current_skin = "tube";
        show_debug_message("Switched to tube. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    } 
    else if (new_skin == "player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
        global.current_skin = "player";
        show_debug_message("Switched to player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    }
    else if (new_skin == "sled_player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
        global.current_skin = "sled_player";
        show_debug_message("Switched to sled_player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    }
}

Warp Block Creation Code: Ensure the warp block's creation code includes the target room and position.
Collision Event: Place the collision event code in obj_warp_block to handle the transition to the sled racing mini-game and switch the player's skin.
Switch Skin Function: Ensure the switch_skin function includes logic for switching to obj_sled_player.
By following these steps, you should be able to correctly implement the collision event and fix the error. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Is that all the event code for the create event?
The code provided previously includes the create event and collision event for obj_warp_block, as well as the switch_skin function. To clarify, here is the complete code for the create event and the collision event for obj_warp_block, along with the switch_skin function, ensuring that everything is in the correct place:

Complete Code for obj_warp_block
1. Creation Code
Ensure the following creation code is added to the specific obj_warp_block instance in the room editor:

game
// Creation Code for obj_warp_block
target_rm = rm_sled_racing;
target_x = 55;
target_y = 235;
target_face = DOWN;
2. Collision Event with obj_player
Add the following code to the collision event of obj_warp_block with obj_player:

game
// Collision Event with obj_player
if (other != noone && other.object_index == obj_player) {
    // Check if the target room is the sled racing mini-game room
    if (target_rm == rm_sled_racing) {
        // Switch the player's skin to obj_sled_player
        switch_skin("sled_player");

        // Move the player to the target room and position
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(target_x, target_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
        room_goto(target_rm);
    }
}
3. switch_skin Function
Ensure the switch_skin function is defined in a script or in an appropriate place in your codebase:

game
/// Function: switch_skin
/// Description: Switches the player's skin to the specified skin.
/// Parameters: new_skin (string) - The name of the skin to switch to.
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x, player_y;

    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        player_x = global.player_instance.x;
        player_y = global.player_instance.y;
        instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    } else {
        // Fallback in case global.player_instance doesn't exist
        player_x = room_width / 2;
        player_y = room_height / 2;
        show_debug_message("Warning: global.player_instance was invalid, defaulting position to room center.");
    }

    if (new_skin == "icetruck") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
        global.current_skin = "icetruck";
        show_debug_message("Switched to icetruck. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    } 
    else if (new_skin == "tube") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_tube);
        global.current_skin = "tube";
        show_debug_message("Switched to tube. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    } 
    else if (new_skin == "player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
        global.current_skin = "player";
        show_debug_message("Switched to player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    }
    else if (new_skin == "sled_player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
        global.current_skin = "sled_player";
        show_debug_message("Switched to sled_player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    }

ERROR!!! :: ############################################################################################
ERROR in action number 1
of Create Event for object obj_sled_player:
Variable obj_sled_player.target_rm(100014, -2147483648) not set before reading it.
 at gml_Object_obj_sled_player_Create_0 (line 49) - if (other.target_rm == rm_sled_racing) {
############################################################################################
gml_Object_obj_sled_player_Create_0 (line 49)
It seems there is an issue with the obj_sled_player's Create event, where it tries to access the target_rm variable that hasn't been set. The collision event code should be placed in obj_warp_block, and not in obj_sled_player.

Let's ensure that the collision event is correctly placed in obj_warp_block and that obj_sled_player does not contain any code that tries to read target_rm.

Correct Event Handling
1. obj_warp_block Creation Code
Ensure the creation code for the warp block includes the target room and position:

game
// Creation Code for obj_warp_block
target_rm = rm_sled_racing;
target_x = 55;
target_y = 235;
target_face = DOWN;
2. Collision Event Code in obj_warp_block
Place the collision event code in obj_warp_block to handle the transition to the sled racing mini-game and switch the player's skin.

game
// Collision Event with obj_player
if (other != noone && other.object_index == obj_player) {
    // Check if the target room is the sled racing mini-game room
    if (target_rm == rm_sled_racing) {
        // Switch the player's skin to obj_sled_player
        switch_skin("sled_player");

        // Move the player to the target room and position
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(target_x, target_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
        room_goto(target_rm);
    }
}
3. Ensure obj_sled_player Does Not Access target_rm
Review the Create event for obj_sled_player to ensure it does not try to access target_rm:

game
// Create Event for obj_sled_player
xspd = 0;
yspd = 0;
move_spd = 4;
lives = 3;

// Additional initialization code if needed
4. switch_skin Function
Ensure the switch_skin function is correctly defined:

game
/// Function: switch_skin
/// Description: Switches the player's skin to the specified skin.
/// Parameters: new_skin (string) - The name of the skin to switch to.
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x, player_y;

    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        player_x = global.player_instance.x;
        player_y = global.player_instance.y;
        instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    } else {
        // Fallback in case global.player_instance doesn't exist
        player_x = room_width / 2;
        player_y = room_height / 2;
        show_debug_message("Warning: global.player_instance was invalid, defaulting position to room center.");
    }

    if (new_skin == "icetruck") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
        global.current_skin = "icetruck";
        show_debug_message("Switched to icetruck. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    } 
    else if (new_skin == "tube") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_tube);
        global.current_skin = "tube";
        show_debug_message("Switched to tube. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    } 
    else if (new_skin == "player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
        global.current_skin = "player";
        show_debug_message("Switched to player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    }
    else if (new_skin == "sled_player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
        global.current_skin = "sled_player";
        show_debug_message("Switched to sled_player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    }
}
Summary
Creation Code: Ensure the warp block's creation code includes the target room and position.
Collision Event: Place the collision event code in obj_warp_block to handle the transition to the sled racing mini-game and switch the player's skin.
Create Event for obj_sled_player: Ensure it does not try to access target_rm.
Switch Skin Function: Ensure the function includes logic for switching to obj_sled_player.
By following these steps, you should be able to correctly implement the collision event and fix the error. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

which event is obj sled player switch skin logic stored?
The switch_skin function is not tied to a specific event within obj_sled_player; rather, it is a standalone function that can be called from anywhere in your codebase. The purpose of the function is to switch the player's skin to the specified type, including changing the player object to obj_sled_player for the mini-game.

Placement of switch_skin Function
Ensure that the switch_skin function is defined in a script or in an appropriate place where it can be accessed by other objects and events in your game.

Example Placement
You can place the switch_skin function in a script file (e.g., scr_switch_skin) that can be called by different objects and events:

Script: scr_switch_skin
game
/// Function: switch_skin
/// Description: Switches the player's skin to the specified skin.
/// Parameters: new_skin (string) - The name of the skin to switch to.
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x, player_y;

    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        player_x = global.player_instance.x;
        player_y = global.player_instance.y;
        instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    } else {
        // Fallback in case global.player_instance doesn't exist
        player_x = room_width / 2;
        player_y = room_height / 2;
        show_debug_message("Warning: global.player_instance was invalid, defaulting position to room center.");
    }

    if (new_skin == "icetruck") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
        global.current_skin = "icetruck";
        show_debug_message("Switched to icetruck. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    } 
    else if (new_skin == "tube") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_tube);
        global.current_skin = "tube";
        show_debug_message("Switched to tube. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    } 
    else if (new_skin == "player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
        global.current_skin = "player";
        show_debug_message("Switched to player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    }
    else if (new_skin == "sled_player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
        global.current_skin = "sled_player";
        show_debug_message("Switched to sled_player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    }
}
Calling the switch_skin Function
You can call this function from the collision event of obj_warp_block to switch the player's skin when entering the mini-game room:

Collision Event in obj_warp_block
game
// Collision Event with obj_player
if (other != noone && other.object_index == obj_player) {
    // Check if the target room is the sled racing mini-game room
    if (target_rm == rm_sled_racing) {
        // Switch the player's skin to obj_sled_player
        switch_skin("sled_player");

        // Move the player to the target room and position
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(target_x, target_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
        room_goto(target_rm);
    }
}
Summary
switch_skin Function: Define this function in a script file (e.g., scr_switch_skin).
Collision Event: Call the switch_skin function in the collision event of obj_warp_block to switch the player's skin when entering the mini-game room.
By following these steps, you can ensure that the skin switching logic is correctly implemented and accessible from the necessary events in your game. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

gml_Object_obj_warp_block_Collision_obj_player (line 6)
The error message indicates that the switch_skin function is not defined or accessible when it is called in the collision event of obj_warp_block.

To resolve this issue, ensure that the switch_skin function is properly defined in a script that is accessible from the collision event of obj_warp_block.

Steps to Fix the Issue
Define switch_skin in a Script:

Create a new script (e.g., scr_switch_skin) and define the switch_skin function within it.
Call the Script from obj_warp_block:

Ensure that the collision event in obj_warp_block calls the switch_skin function correctly.
Example Implementation
Script: scr_switch_skin
Define the switch_skin function in a script:

game
// scr_switch_skin

/// Function: switch_skin
/// Description: Switches the player's skin to the specified skin.
/// Parameters: new_skin (string) - The name of the skin to switch to.
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x, player_y;

    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        player_x = global.player_instance.x;
        player_y = global.player_instance.y;
        instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    } else {
        // Fallback in case global.player_instance doesn't exist
        player_x = room_width / 2;
        player_y = room_height / 2;
        show_debug_message("Warning: global.player_instance was invalid, defaulting position to room center.");
    }

    if (new_skin == "icetruck") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
        global.current_skin = "icetruck";
        show_debug_message("Switched to icetruck. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    } 
    else if (new_skin == "tube") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_tube);
        global.current_skin = "tube";
        show_debug_message("Switched to tube. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    } 
    else if (new_skin == "player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
        global.current_skin = "player";
        show_debug_message("Switched to player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    }
    else if (new_skin == "sled_player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
        global.current_skin = "sled_player";
        show_debug_message("Switched to sled_player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    }
}
Collision Event in obj_warp_block
Ensure that the collision event calls the switch_skin function from the script:

game
// Collision Event with obj_player
if (other != noone && other.object_index == obj_player) {
    // Check if the target room is the sled racing mini-game room
    if (target_rm == rm_sled_racing) {
        // Call the switch_skin script to switch the player's skin to obj_sled_player
        switch_skin("sled_player");

        // Move the player to the target room and position
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(target_x, target_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
        room_goto(target_rm);
    }
}
Summary
Define switch_skin in a Script: Create a script (e.g., scr_switch_skin) and define the switch_skin function there.
Call the Script from obj_warp_block: Ensure the collision event in obj_warp_block calls the switch_skin function correctly.
By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and ensure that the switch_skin function is correctly called when the player collides with the warp block. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Ive have updated the output log for you review penguinislegithubfiles/debugoutput1.txt. The player successfully transitions into rm_sled_racing although the players viewport camera doesnt follow the player
From the debug output, it appears that the player successfully transitions into rm_sled_racing, but the viewport camera does not follow the player. This issue is likely due to the camera not being properly synchronized with the player's position after the transition.

Steps to Ensure Camera Follows the Player
Create a Global Camera Controller:

Ensure you have a global camera controller that manages the camera's position relative to the player.
Synchronize the Camera with the Player:

Update the camera's position in the Step event of the camera controller to follow the player.
Example Implementation
1. Create a Global Camera Controller
Create an object called obj_camera_controller and ensure it is persistent across rooms.

2. Add Camera Synchronization Logic
Add the following logic to the Step event of obj_camera_controller:

game
// Step Event for obj_camera_controller
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
    var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

    // Center the camera on the player
    var cam_width = camera_get_view_width(view_camera[0]);
    var cam_height = camera_get_view_height(view_camera[0]);
    
    var cam_x = clamp(player_x - cam_width / 2, 0, room_width - cam_width);
    var cam_y = clamp(player_y - cam_height / 2, 0, room_height - cam_height);
    
    camera_set_view_pos(view_camera[0], cam_x, cam_y);
}
3. Ensure the Camera Controller is Initialized
Make sure the obj_camera_controller is created at the start of the game. You can place it in the first room of your game or create it dynamically if it doesn't exist.

game
// In the first room's creation code or an initializing script
if (!instance_exists(obj_camera_controller)) {
    instance_create_layer(0, 0, "Instances", obj_camera_controller);
}
Example of Room Transition Logic
Ensure the room transition logic correctly initializes the player and the camera:

game
// Collision Event with obj_player in obj_warp_block
if (other != noone && other.object_index == obj_player) {
    if (target_rm == rm_sled_racing) {
        switch_skin("sled_player");

        // Move the player to the target room and position
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(target_x, target_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
        room_goto(target_rm);
    }
}

// Room Start Event for obj_sled_player
// Ensure the player is properly initialized
global.player_instance = id;
Summary
Camera Controller: Create a global camera controller object (obj_camera_controller) that is persistent across rooms.
Step Event for Camera Controller: Add logic to the Step event to synchronize the camera's position with the player's position.
Initialization: Ensure the obj_camera_controller is initialized at the start of the game or dynamically if it doesn't exist.
Room Transition: Ensure the room transition logic correctly initializes the player and the camera.
By following these steps, the viewport camera should follow the player as they transition into the rm_sled_racing room. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Could you please check out the camera object that already exists, can the code be combined so I dont have two? HotBed/Penguin Isles Project/repository_index.txt
It seems there was an issue retrieving the repository_index.txt file. However, I can guide you on how to check your existing camera object and integrate the necessary camera-following logic.

Steps to Combine Camera Object Logic
Locate the Existing Camera Object:

Identify the existing camera object in your project.
Review the Existing Camera Logic:

Open the camera object and review its events and scripts.
Integrate the Camera-Following Logic:

Add the camera-following logic to the existing camera object to ensure it follows the player.
Example Integration
Assuming your existing camera object is named obj_camera, you can integrate the following logic to ensure it follows the player:

1. Locate obj_camera
Open obj_camera in your GameMaker project.

2. Add Camera-Following Logic
Add the following code to the Step event of obj_camera:

game
// Step Event for obj_camera
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
    var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

    // Center the camera on the player
    var cam_width = camera_get_view_width(view_camera[0]);
    var cam_height = camera_get_view_height(view_camera[0]);
    
    var cam_x = clamp(player_x - cam_width / 2, 0, room_width - cam_width);
    var cam_y = clamp(player_y - cam_height / 2, 0, room_height - cam_height);
    
    camera_set_view_pos(view_camera[0], cam_x, cam_y);
}
Summary
Locate the Existing Camera Object (obj_camera) in your project.
Review the Existing Camera Logic to understand how it operates.
Integrate the Camera-Following Logic into the Step event of obj_camera to ensure it follows the player.
By following these steps, you can combine the camera-following logic with your existing camera object, avoiding the need to create a separate camera object. If you need further assistance or specific details about the existing camera object, please provide more information or the relevant code sections.

here you go, try again Penguin Isles Project/repository_index.txt
The Step event for obj_camera already contains logic to follow the player. Here is the code from Step_0.gml:

game
// Step Event for obj_camera

// Ensure the player instance exists
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    var target_x = global.player_instance.x - (camera_get_view_width(global.camera) / 2);
    var target_y = global.player_instance.y - (camera_get_view_height(global.camera) / 2);

    target_x = clamp(target_x, 0, room_width - camera_get_view_width(global.camera));
    target_y = clamp(target_y, 0, room_height - camera_get_view_height(global.camera));

    camera_set_view_pos(global.camera, target_x, target_y);
}
Ensuring Camera Initialization and Synchronization
Let's ensure that the camera is properly initialized and follows the player during room transitions.

1. Initialize the Camera
Ensure the camera is created and initialized in your game. This can be done in a controller object or the first room of your game.

game
// In the initialization script or first room's creation code

if (!instance_exists(obj_camera)) {
    instance_create_layer(0, 0, "Instances", obj_camera);
}

// Initialize the global camera
global.camera = camera_create();
camera_set_view_size(global.camera, view_wview[0], view_hview[0]);
camera_set_view_target(global.camera, obj_player);
view_camera[0] = global.camera;
2. Ensure Global Player Instance
Make sure that global.player_instance is correctly set when switching the player skin.

game
// Switch Skin Function
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x, player_y;

    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        player_x = global.player_instance.x;
        player_y = global.player_instance.y;
        instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    } else {
        player_x = room_width / 2;
        player_y = room_height / 2;
        show_debug_message("Warning: global.player_instance was invalid, defaulting position to room center.");
    }

    if (new_skin == "icetruck") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
    } 
    else if (new_skin == "tube") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_tube);
    } 
    else if (new_skin == "player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
    }
    else if (new_skin == "sled_player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
    }

    global.current_skin = new_skin;
    show_debug_message("Switched to " + new_skin + ". Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
}
3. Update Room Transition Logic
Ensure the room transition logic correctly initializes the player and updates the camera.

game
// Collision Event with obj_player in obj_warp_block
if (other != noone && other.object_index == obj_player) {
    if (target_rm == rm_sled_racing) {
        switch_skin("sled_player");

        // Move the player to the target room and position
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(target_x, target_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
        room_goto(target_rm);
    }
}

// Room Start Event for obj_sled_player
global.player_instance = id;
Summary
Initialize the Camera: Ensure the camera is created and initialized in your game.
Ensure Global Player Instance: Make sure global.player_instance is correctly set when switching the player skin.
Update Room Transition Logic: Ensure the room transition logic correctly initializes the player and updates the camera.
By following these steps, the existing camera object (obj_camera) should be able to follow the player correctly during room transitions. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

I do have an obj_initializer, please refernece the index for its location, Can you provide the full event code for Ensuring Camera Initialization and Synchronization. I want to be able to quickly add the revised code to my project buy copying the full code
Sure, let's integrate the camera initialization and synchronization logic into the obj_initializer. According to the repository_index.txt, obj_initializer is located in Penguin Isles Project/objects/obj_initializer/.

Full Event Code for obj_initializer
We will include the initialization of the camera and ensure the global player instance is set correctly. This will help to ensure that the camera follows the player properly during room transitions.

Create Event for obj_initializer
game

    var target_x = global.player_instance.x - (camera_get_view_width(global.camera) / 2);
    var target_y = global.player_instance.y - (camera_get_view_height(global.camera) / 2);

    target_x = clamp(target_x, 0, room_width - camera_get_view_width(global.camera));
    target_y = clamp(target_y, 0, room_height - camera_get_view_height(global.camera));

    camera_set_view_pos(global.camera, target_x, target_y);
}
Room Start Event for obj_sled_player
Ensure the global player instance is set correctly during the room start event for obj_sled_player.

game
// Room Start Event for obj_sled_player

}
Switch Skin Function
Ensure that the switch_skin function is defined and used correctly to set the global player instance.

Script: scr_switch_skin
game
// scr_switch_skin

/// Function: switch_skin
/// Description: Switches the player's skin to the specified skin.
/// Parameters: new_skin (string) - The name of the skin to switch to.
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x, player_y;

    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        player_x = global.player_instance.x;
        player_y = global.player_instance.y;
        instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    } else {
        player_x = room_width / 2;
        player_y = room_height / 2;
        show_debug_message("Warning: global.player_instance was invalid, defaulting position to room center.");
    }

    if (new_skin == "icetruck") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
    } 
    else if (new_skin == "tube") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_tube);
    } 
    else if (new_skin == "player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
    }
    else if (new_skin == "sled_player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
    }

    global.current_skin = new_skin;
    show_debug_message("Switched to " + new_skin + ". Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
}
Adding switch_skin Call in Room Transition Logic
Ensure the room transition logic correctly initializes the player and updates the camera.

Collision Event in obj_warp_block
game
// Collision Event with obj_player in obj_warp_block

if (other != noone && other.object_index == obj_player) {
    if (target_rm == rm_sled_racing) {
        switch_skin("sled_player");

        // Move the player to the target room and position
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(target_x, target_y, "Instances", obj_sled_player);
        room_goto(target_rm);
    }
}

// Room Start Event for obj_sled_player
global.player_instance = id;
Summary
Step Event for obj_camera: Ensure the camera follows the player.
Room Start Event for obj_sled_player: Set the global player instance correctly.
Create Event for obj_initializer: Ensure the camera is initialized and the global player instance is set correctly.
Switch Skin Function: Use the switch_skin function to switch the player's skin and set the global player instance.
Room Transition Logic: Ensure the room transition logic correctly initializes the player and updates the camera.
By following this full event code, you can ensure that the camera initialization and synchronization are correctly implemented in your project. If the issue persists or you need further assistance, please provide additional details or logs for further investigation.

Perfect now the camera is focused on the player, how ever the player is unable to move, I want there movement restricted to only moving left and right and the sprite should stay the stame. the obstacles are also meant to move up from the bottom. Ive placed their object at the bottom of the room. Please also add some collision logic so the player cant go through the obstacle.Can you make a tile layer look like its moving in a upwards motion
Great, let's update the player movement, obstacle behavior, and tile layer. Here is a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. Update Player Movement
Restrict the player to move only left and right and ensure the sprite remains the same.

Step Event for obj_sled_player
game
// Step Event for obj_sled_player

// Horizontal movement
if (keyboard_check(vk_left)) {
    x -= 5; // Move left
} 
else if (keyboard_check(vk_right)) {
    x += 5; // Move right
}

// Prevent movement outside the room boundaries
x = clamp(x, 0, room_width - sprite_width);

// Check for collision with obstacles
if (place_meeting(x, y, obj_obstacle)) {
    // Handle collision (e.g., stop movement, end game, etc.)
    show_debug_message("Collision with obstacle!");
    // You can add more logic here to handle what happens on collision
}
2. Obstacle Behavior
Ensure obstacles move from the bottom to the top of the room.

Step Event for obj_obstacle
game
// Step Event for obj_obstacle

// Move the obstacle upwards
y -= 5; // Adjust speed as needed

// Destroy the obstacle if it moves out of the room
if (y < -sprite_height) {
    instance_destroy();
}
3. Tile Layer Upwards Motion
Create a tile layer that looks like it's moving upwards.

Step Event for obj_tile_layer
game
// Step Event for obj_tile_layer

// Move the tile layer upwards
layer_vspeed("TileLayer", -2); // Adjust speed as needed

// Reset the tile layer position when it moves out of view
if (layer_get_y("TileLayer") <= -room_height) {
    layer_set_y("TileLayer", 0);
}
Summary
Update Player Movement: Restrict the player to move only left and right and handle collisions with obstacles.
Obstacle Behavior: Move obstacles from the bottom to the top and destroy them when they move out of the room.
Tile Layer Upwards Motion: Create an upward moving tile layer to simulate motion.
Full Code Integration
Below is the full integration of the described logic:

Step Event for obj_sled_player
game
// Step Event for obj_sled_player

// Horizontal movement
if (keyboard_check(vk_left)) {
    x -= 5; // Move left
} 
else if (keyboard_check(vk_right)) {
    x += 5; // Move right
}

// Prevent movement outside the room boundaries
x = clamp(x, 0, room_width - sprite_width);

// Check for collision with obstacles
if (place_meeting(x, y, obj_obstacle)) {
    // Handle collision (e.g., stop movement, end game, etc.)
    show_debug_message("Collision with obstacle!");
    // You can add more logic here to handle what happens on collision
}
Step Event for obj_obstacle
game
// Step Event for obj_obstacle

// Move the obstacle upwards
y -= 5; // Adjust speed as needed

// Destroy the obstacle if it moves out of the room
if (y < -sprite_height) {
    instance_destroy();
}
Step Event for obj_tile_layer
game
// Step Event for obj_tile_layer

// Move the tile layer upwards
layer_vspeed("TileLayer", -2); // Adjust speed as needed

// Reset the tile layer position when it moves out of view
if (layer_get_y("TileLayer") <= -room_height) {
    layer_set_y("TileLayer", 0);
}
By implementing these changes, your game should have the player restricted to horizontal movement, obstacles moving upwards from the bottom, and a tile layer that creates an upward motion effect. If you have any further questions or need additional adjustments, feel free to ask!

The obstacles move up correctly now, it really sells the illusion of the player moving down. However the player also isnt moving left or right. I think there might be a overlap in the controllers movement code and the obj sled player logic, because im thinking that just cause the camera is on the sled player doesnt mean the controls arent still with the controller. The obj tile layer doesnt look like its moving up, its sprite it 96 x 32 if that helps, are their any other sprite settings I should change to help sell the effect. I also update the output log for you review; penguinislegithubfiles/objects 1/recentoutputlog.txt
Based on the recent output log, it seems that the obj_controller still might be handling the controls and that could be interfering with the obj_sled_player's movement. Let's address this and also ensure the tile layer appears to move upwards effectively.

1. Ensure obj_controller Does Not Interfere with obj_sled_player
We need to make sure that the obj_controller does not override the movement logic for obj_sled_player.

Step Event for obj_controller
Check if the controller is handling the player's movement and adjust accordingly.

game
// Step Event for obj_controller

// Ensure this is not affecting obj_sled_player
if (global.current_skin != "sled_player") {
    // Existing movement logic for other player skins
    if (keyboard_check(vk_left)) {
        global.player_instance.x -= 5;
    } 
    else if (keyboard_check(vk_right)) {
        global.player_instance.x += 5;
    }

    // Prevent movement outside the room boundaries
    global.player_instance.x = clamp(global.player_instance.x, 0, room_width - sprite_width);
}
2. Update obj_sled_player Movement
Ensure obj_sled_player correctly handles left and right movement.

Step Event for obj_sled_player
game
// Step Event for obj_sled_player

// Horizontal movement
if (keyboard_check(vk_left)) {
    x -= 5; // Move left
} 
else if (keyboard_check(vk_right)) {
    x += 5; // Move right
}

// Prevent movement outside the room boundaries
x = clamp(x, 0, room_width - sprite_width);

// Check for collision with obstacles
if (place_meeting(x, y, obj_obstacle)) {
    // Handle collision (e.g., stop movement, end game, etc.)
    show_debug_message("Collision with obstacle!");
    // You can add more logic here to handle what happens on collision
}
3. Enhance the Tile Layer Upwards Motion
To create a convincing upwards motion effect, we need to ensure the tile layer scrolls smoothly.

Step Event for obj_tile_layer
game
// Step Event for obj_tile_layer

// Move the tile layer upwards
layer_y("TileLayer", layer_get_y("TileLayer") - 2); // Adjust speed as needed

// Reset the tile layer position when it moves out of view
if (layer_get_y("TileLayer") <= -room_height) {
    layer_set_y("TileLayer", 0);
}
Tile Layer Configuration
Make sure the tile layer is set up correctly in the room editor. If the tile layer's sprite is 96x32, consider the following:

Tile Layer Size: Ensure the tile layer covers the entire room width.
Tile Layer Offset: Adjust the offset to ensure seamless scrolling.
Full Code Integration
Below is the full integration of the described logic:

Step Event for obj_controller
game
// Step Event for obj_controller

// Ensure this is not affecting obj_sled_player
if (global.current_skin != "sled_player") {
    // Existing movement logic for other player skins
    if (keyboard_check(vk_left)) {
        global.player_instance.x -= 5;
    } 
    else if (keyboard_check(vk_right)) {
        global.player_instance.x += 5;
    }

    // Prevent movement outside the room boundaries
    global.player_instance.x = clamp(global.player_instance.x, 0, room_width - sprite_width);
}
Step Event for obj_sled_player
game
// Step Event for obj_sled_player

// Horizontal movement
if (keyboard_check(vk_left)) {
    x -= 5; // Move left
} 
else if (keyboard_check(vk_right)) {
    x += 5; // Move right
}

// Prevent movement outside the room boundaries
x = clamp(x, 0, room_width - sprite_width);

// Check for collision with obstacles
if (place_meeting(x, y, obj_obstacle)) {
    // Handle collision (e.g., stop movement, end game, etc.)
    show_debug_message("Collision with obstacle!");
    // You can add more logic here to handle what happens on collision
}
Step Event for obj_tile_layer
game
// Step Event for obj_tile_layer

// Move the tile layer upwards
layer_y("TileLayer", layer_get_y("TileLayer") - 2); // Adjust speed as needed

// Reset the tile layer position when it moves out of view
if (layer_get_y("TileLayer") <= -room_height) {
    layer_set_y("TileLayer", 0);
}
By implementing these changes, your game should have the player moving left and right correctly, the obstacles moving upwards, and a tile layer creating an upward motion effect. If you have any further questions or need additional adjustments, feel free to ask!

Ok that works, I was trying to move the player with 'A' & 'D' to go left and right (can you add those controls to the sled player. Im happy with the effect the obstacles give when moving, im decieding to remove the obj_tile_layer, its not needed. now want to expand on the minigame a little bit overall. I dont want to have a bunch of obstacles objects in the room, is their anyway you can set up them up in a way so them after they pass up past the player and are out of the camera viewport their positons are reset and they move up again, 
Absolutely! Let's modify the player controls to use 'A' and 'D' for left and right movement, remove the obj_tile_layer, and set up the obstacles to reset their positions after moving out of the camera viewport.

1. Update Player Controls
Update the obj_sled_player to use 'A' and 'D' keys for left and right movement.

Step Event for obj_sled_player
game
// Step Event for obj_sled_player

// Horizontal movement using 'A' and 'D' keys
if (keyboard_check(ord('A'))) {
    x -= 5; // Move left
} 
else if (keyboard_check(ord('D'))) {
    x += 5; // Move right
}

// Prevent movement outside the room boundaries
x = clamp(x, 0, room_width - sprite_width);

// Check for collision with obstacles
if (place_meeting(x, y, obj_obstacle)) {
    // Handle collision (e.g., stop movement, end game, etc.)
    show_debug_message("Collision with obstacle!");
    // Add more logic here to handle what happens on collision
}
2. Remove obj_tile_layer
Since the tile layer is no longer needed, you can simply remove its creation and step events to clean up your code.

3. Recycle Obstacles
To recycle obstacles after they move past the player and out of the camera viewport, we will reset their positions.

Step Event for obj_obstacle
game
// Step Event for obj_obstacle

// Move the obstacle upwards
y -= 5; // Adjust speed as needed

// Reset the obstacle's position if it moves out of the camera viewport
if (y < -sprite_height) {
    y = room_height + sprite_height; // Reset to below the viewport
    x = irandom_range(0, room_width - sprite_width); // Randomize horizontal position
}
Summary
Update Player Controls: Use 'A' and 'D' keys for left and right movement.
Remove obj_tile_layer: Remove the tile layer as it's no longer needed.
Recycle Obstacles: Reset the obstacles' positions after they move out of the camera viewport.
Full Code Integration
Below is the full integration of the described logic:

Step Event for obj_sled_player
game
// Step Event for obj_sled_player

// Horizontal movement using 'A' and 'D' keys
if (keyboard_check(ord('A'))) {
    x -= 5; // Move left
} 
else if (keyboard_check(ord('D'))) {
    x += 5; // Move right
}

// Prevent movement outside the room boundaries
x = clamp(x, 0, room_width - sprite_width);

// Check for collision with obstacles
if (place_meeting(x, y, obj_obstacle)) {
    // Handle collision (e.g., stop movement, end game, etc.)
    show_debug_message("Collision with obstacle!");
    // Add more logic here to handle what happens on collision
}
Step Event for obj_obstacle
game
// Step Event for obj_obstacle

// Move the obstacle upwards
y -= 5; // Adjust speed as needed

// Reset the obstacle's position if it moves out of the camera viewport
if (y < -sprite_height) {
    y = room_height + sprite_height; // Reset to below the viewport
    x = irandom_range(0, room_width - sprite_width); // Randomize horizontal position
}
By implementing these changes, your game should now have the player moving left and right using 'A' and 'D' keys, and the obstacles will reset their positions after moving out of the viewport, creating a continuous flow of obstacles. If you have any further questions or need additional adjustments, feel free to ask!

the obstacle recycling works now thank you, I think you misunderstood, I want to be able to control the sled player using both A and D aswell as the left and right arrow keys to move the player. When rm_sled_racing room starts the player should see a 5 second countdown timer and during that time no obstacles are moving once the timer has reached zero that when the game starts properly and the obstacles begin moving, Now when the player has collided with an obstacle 3 times and used up their lives they should be automatically transitioned to the rm_ski_mountaintop. If after 10 seconds the player has any lives left, they will be automatically tranistioned to the rm_ski_village.
Understood! Let's implement the following features:

Control the obj_sled_player using both 'A' and 'D' keys as well as the left and right arrow keys.
Add a 5-second countdown timer at the start of the rm_sled_racing room.
Start the obstacle movement after the countdown reaches zero.
Transition the player to rm_ski_mountaintop after 3 collisions with obstacles.
Transition the player to rm_ski_village if they have any lives left after 10 seconds.
1. Update Player Controls
Update the obj_sled_player to use both 'A' and 'D' keys as well as the left and right arrow keys for movement.

Step Event for obj_sled_player
game
// Step Event for obj_sled_player

// Horizontal movement using 'A', 'D' keys and arrow keys
if (keyboard_check(vk_left) || keyboard_check(ord('A'))) {
    x -= 5; // Move left
} 
else if (keyboard_check(vk_right) || keyboard_check(ord('D'))) {
    x += 5; // Move right
}

// Prevent movement outside the room boundaries
x = clamp(x, 0, room_width - sprite_width);

// Check for collision with obstacles
if (place_meeting(x, y, obj_obstacle)) {
    // Handle collision (e.g., stop movement, end game, etc.)
    show_debug_message("Collision with obstacle!");
    // Add more logic here to handle what happens on collision
}
2. Add Countdown Timer and Start Obstacle Movement
Create a countdown timer at the start of the room and start obstacle movement after the countdown reaches zero.

Create Event for obj_controller
Initialize the countdown timer and set up variables.

game
// Create Event for obj_controller

countdown_timer = 5 * room_speed; // 5 seconds countdown
game_started = false; // Flag to check if the game has started
global.lives = 3; // Initialize player lives
Step Event for obj_controller
Update the countdown timer and start the game.

game
// Step Event for obj_controller

if (!game_started) {
    countdown_timer -= 1;
    if (countdown_timer <= 0) {
        game_started = true;
    }
} else {
    // Game logic goes here
    // Check for collisions and reduce lives
    if (place_meeting(global.player_instance.x, global.player_instance.y, obj_obstacle)) {
        global.lives -= 1;
        show_debug_message("Collision! Lives left: " + string(global.lives));
        if (global.lives <= 0) {
            room_goto(rm_ski_mountaintop);
        }
    }
}
3. Transition After 10 Seconds if Lives Left
Add logic to transition the player after 10 seconds if they have any lives left.

Create Event for obj_controller
Initialize the game timer.

game
// Create Event for obj_controller

game_timer = 0; // Initialize game timer
Step Event for obj_controller
Update the game timer and check for transitions.

game
// Step Event for obj_controller

if (!game_started) {
    countdown_timer -= 1;
    if (countdown_timer <= 0) {
        game_started = true;
        game_timer = 10 * room_speed; // 10 seconds game timer
    }
} else {
    // Game logic goes here
    game_timer -= 1;
    if (game_timer <= 0 && global.lives > 0) {
        room_goto(rm_ski_village);
    }

    // Check for collisions and reduce lives
    if (place_meeting(global.player_instance.x, global.player_instance.y, obj_obstacle)) {
        global.lives -= 1;
        show_debug_message("Collision! Lives left: " + string(global.lives));
        if (global.lives <= 0) {
            room_goto(rm_ski_mountaintop);
        }
    }
}
Summary
Update Player Controls: Use both 'A' and 'D' keys as well as the left and right arrow keys for movement.
Add Countdown Timer: Add a 5-second countdown timer at the start of the rm_sled_racing room.
Start Obstacle Movement: Start obstacle movement after the countdown reaches zero.
Collision Logic: Transition the player to rm_ski_mountaintop after 3 collisions with obstacles.
Game Timer: Transition the player to rm_ski_village if they have any lives left after 10 seconds.
By implementing these changes, your game should now have the desired controls, countdown timer, obstacle movement, and transition logic. If you have any further questions or need additional adjustments, feel free to ask!

Ive ran the code and am happy with the results. The game did crash when tranistioning the player, but I think its due to the controllers skin still being sled player. it should be quickly changed back to the obj player skin before the room transition starts, I also couldnt see the 5 second countdown, can you draw an actual black "5", "4" "3". "2", "1". counting down one by one
Sure, let's address both issues:

Change Skin Back to obj_player Before Room Transition:

We'll add logic to switch the player's skin back to obj_player before transitioning to the next room.
Draw the 5-Second Countdown:

We'll draw the countdown timer on the screen.
1. Change Skin Back to obj_player Before Room Transition
We'll modify the obj_controller to switch the player's skin back to obj_player before transitioning to the next room.

Step Event for obj_controller
Update the room transition logic to switch the skin.

game
// Step Event for obj_controller

if (!game_started) {
    countdown_timer -= 1;
    if (countdown_timer <= 0) {
        game_started = true;
        game_timer = 10 * room_speed; // 10 seconds game timer
    }
} else {
    // Game logic goes here
    game_timer -= 1;
    if (game_timer <= 0 && global.lives > 0) {
        switch_skin("player");
        room_goto(rm_ski_village);
    }

    // Check for collisions and reduce lives
    if (place_meeting(global.player_instance.x, global.player_instance.y, obj_obstacle)) {
        global.lives -= 1;
        show_debug_message("Collision! Lives left: " + string(global.lives));
        if (global.lives <= 0) {
            switch_skin("player");
            room_goto(rm_ski_mountaintop);
        }
    }
}
2. Draw the 5-Second Countdown
We'll draw the countdown timer on the screen using the Draw event in the obj_controller.

Create Event for obj_controller
Initialize the countdown timer and set up variables.

game
// Create Event for obj_controller

countdown_timer = 5 * room_speed; // 5 seconds countdown
game_started = false; // Flag to check if the game has started
global.lives = 3; // Initialize player lives
game_timer = 0; // Initialize game timer
Draw Event for obj_controller
Draw the countdown timer on the screen.

game
// Draw Event for obj_controller

// Call the default draw event to ensure other objects are drawn
draw_self();

if (!game_started) {
    var countdown_seconds = ceil(countdown_timer / room_speed);
    draw_set_color(c_black);
    draw_set_font(fnt_countdown); // Ensure you have a font resource named fnt_countdown
    draw_text(room_width / 2 - 10, room_height / 2 - 20, string(countdown_seconds));
}
Full Code Integration
Below is the full integration of the described logic:

Step Event for obj_controller
game
// Step Event for obj_controller

if (!game_started) {
    countdown_timer -= 1;
    if (countdown_timer <= 0) {
        game_started = true;
        game_timer = 10 * room_speed; // 10 seconds game timer
    }
} else {
    // Game logic goes here
    game_timer -= 1;
    if (game_timer <= 0 && global.lives > 0) {
        switch_skin("player");
        room_goto(rm_ski_village);
    }

    // Check for collisions and reduce lives
    if (place_meeting(global.player_instance.x, global.player_instance.y, obj_obstacle)) {
        global.lives -= 1;
        show_debug_message("Collision! Lives left: " + string(global.lives));
        if (global.lives <= 0) {
            switch_skin("player");
            room_goto(rm_ski_mountaintop);
        }
    }
}
Draw Event for obj_controller
game
// Draw Event for obj_controller

// Call the default draw event to ensure other objects are drawn
draw_self();

if (!game_started) {
    var countdown_seconds = ceil(countdown_timer / room_speed);
    draw_set_color(c_black);
    draw_set_font(fnt_countdown); // Ensure you have a font resource named fnt_countdown
    draw_text(room_width / 2 - 10, room_height / 2 - 20, string(countdown_seconds));
}
By implementing these changes, your game should now correctly change the player's skin before transitioning to the next room and display a 5-second countdown timer. If you have any further questions or need additional adjustments, feel free to ask!
