GameMaker Project Analysis Report
1. Key Features
Controller Object
Dynamic Skin Management:
The controller initializes and manages global variables for skin selection (global.skins and global.current_skin).
Supports skin switching functionality, enabling the player to change skins dynamically during gameplay.
Player Instance Management:
Dynamically creates player instances (global.player_instance) based on the selected skin.
Ensures consistency by destroying and recreating the player instance when switching skins.
Debug Logging:
Includes logging mechanisms to track changes in player skin and instance state for debugging purposes.
Player Object
Movement and Interaction:
Handles basic movement (xspd, yspd) and advanced mechanics such as sliding and vehicle driving.
Enables interaction with NPCs and environment through keypress detection (keyboard_check_pressed).
NPCs and UI
NPC Behavior:
Implements directional movement and randomized dialogues for NPCs to enhance interactivity.
UI Elements:
Features dynamic skin pickers, buttons, and other menu-related objects for a user-friendly interface.
2. Bug Identification
Overlapping Key Events (Player Object):
The "E" key is used for both interacting with NPCs and switching skins, potentially leading to conflicts if both actions are possible at the same time.
Unvalidated Player Instance (Controller):
The code assumes the existence of global.player_instance without robust checks, risking crashes if the instance is destroyed unexpectedly.
3. Code Analysis
Weak or Redundant Code Sections
Skin Switching Logic:
Repeated code for skin assignment is present in multiple events (obj_controller_create and switch_skin).
Hardcoded Elements:
NPC sprite directions and UI layouts are hardcoded, reducing scalability.
Optimization Suggestions
Centralize Player Instance Logic:
Create a reusable function for player instance initialization to avoid redundancy.
Dynamic Assignments:
Use loops or data-driven approaches for sprite and UI assignments to improve scalability.
4. Functionality Understanding
Interactions and Gameplay Flow:

The obj_controller acts as a global manager, coordinating the player, skins, and game states.
NPCs and UI objects enhance the world-building and provide user interactivity.
Core Contribution:

Dynamic skin switching adds player customization, while NPC interactions create a sense of immersion.
5. Recommendations for Improvement
Refactor Skin Logic:
Consolidate repeated skin switching code into a single, reusable function.
Enhance Input Handling:
Implement a priority system or contextual inputs to avoid keypress conflicts (e.g., "E" key).
Improve Scalability:
Replace hardcoded values with data-driven approaches for NPC sprites and UI layouts.
Robust Instance Validation:
Add checks to ensure global.player_instance is valid before accessing or destroying it.
Debug Message Optimization:
Reduce the frequency and verbosity of debug logs to highlight critical issues.
