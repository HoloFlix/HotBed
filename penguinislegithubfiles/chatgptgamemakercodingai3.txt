My latest problem lies within the debugoutput2.txt. The player interacts with the obj_icetruck and the players skin switches to obj_player_icetruck, however the obj_icetruck the player interacted with first stays in the room when it should be removed/destroyed and lastly when the player moved into a different room and then exits the icetruck, the gamecrashes
ChatGPT said:

The crash and lingering instance issue with obj_icetruck after the player switches to obj_player_icetruck seems to stem from an incomplete destruction of the obj_icetruck instance. Here's a breakdown of potential causes and solutions:

Problem Breakdown:
Lingering obj_icetruck – When the player interacts with the obj_icetruck, the object is not properly destroyed.
Room Transition Crash – When transitioning to a new room and exiting the icetruck, the game crashes, likely due to references to the destroyed or non-existent instance.
Common Causes:
instance_destroy() Timing:
Even if instance_destroy() is called, the instance persists until the current event completes. Any further code referencing the instance within the same event can cause the game to behave unpredictably​.

Destroy Event Not Triggering:
If instance_destroy() is used incorrectly (such as skipping the destroy event), the icetruck might not fully clean up references or associated resources​.

Persistent Instance:
If the obj_icetruck instance or room is set to persistent, it won't be destroyed even if instance_destroy() is called.

Room Transitioning Without Cleanup:
If obj_icetruck remains in the room and the player exits, lingering instances could cause errors when room-specific resources are accessed.

Potential Fixes:
Ensure Proper Instance Destruction:
Use the following code to destroy the obj_icetruck instance immediately:
gml
Copy code
with (other) {
    instance_destroy();
}
Or, if you need to destroy a specific instance:

gml
Copy code
instance_destroy(id);
Make sure this is done within the interaction or collision event between the player and the obj_icetruck.

Check for Existing Instances Before Access:
Before referencing the obj_icetruck after switching to obj_player_icetruck, use instance_exists() to avoid null references.
gml
Copy code
if (instance_exists(obj_icetruck)) {
    // Safe to interact with obj_icetruck
}
Non-Persistent Room Setup:
Ensure the room containing obj_icetruck is not persistent by setting:
gml
Copy code
room_persistent = false;
Cleanup on Room End:
Add a cleanup event in the obj_icetruck to ensure any associated data or instances are removed:
gml
Copy code
instance_destroy();
Debugging Tips:
Add debug messages in the destroy event of obj_icetruck to verify the instance is destroyed:
gml
Copy code
show_debug_message("obj_icetruck destroyed");
Ensure instance_destroy() is not followed by code that references the destroyed instance.
If the problem persists after applying these fixes, let me know, and we can dive deeper into specific object code and event sequences.

ChatGPT said:

I couldn't locate debugoutput2.txt directly in the search, but based on the context of the issue with obj_icetruck and obj_player_icetruck, here's a step-by-step guide to address the destruction and room transition crash.

Step-by-Step Fix for obj_icetruck Destruction and Transition Crash:
1. Open obj_icetruck's Collision or Interaction Event with the Player:
In GameMaker, open the obj_icetruck object.
Navigate to the Collision Event with obj_player or the Key Press/Interaction Event.
2. Destroy obj_icetruck on Interaction:
Replace or add this code in the event where the player enters the icetruck:
gml
Copy code
with (other) {
    instance_destroy();
}
This ensures that the interacting obj_icetruck is destroyed immediately when the player enters it.
3. Destroy obj_icetruck on Room Transition:
Go to the Room End Event in obj_icetruck.
Add the following code:
gml
Copy code
instance_destroy();
This prevents the obj_icetruck from persisting across room transitions, avoiding references to non-existent objects.
4. Check for Existing Instances:
Before interacting with the icetruck in the player object (obj_player), check if the instance exists:
gml
Copy code
if (instance_exists(obj_icetruck)) {
    // Continue interaction logic
}
This prevents crashes if the icetruck has already been destroyed.
5. Handle Player Switching to obj_player_icetruck:
In the code where the player transitions to obj_player_icetruck, add:
gml
Copy code
instance_create_layer(x, y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
instance_destroy();
This destroys the player instance and spawns obj_player_icetruck in the same location.
6. Verify Persistent Room Settings:
Ensure the room containing obj_icetruck is not persistent.
In the room properties, set:
gml
Copy code
room_persistent = false;
Debugging and Testing:
Add Debug Messages:

In the obj_icetruck Destroy Event:
gml
Copy code
show_debug_message("obj_icetruck destroyed");
This will confirm if the icetruck is correctly removed.
Test Room Transition:

Transition between rooms multiple times and interact with the icetruck.
Check the debug console for errors or lingering instances.
If the crash continues, I can extract and analyze the specific error from debugoutput2.txt if you upload it separately or confirm its content.

The issue of the obj_icetruck persisting after switching to obj_player_icetruck and the room transition crash seems to stem from the instance_destroy() calls and recreation logic in obj_icetruck_step.txt​. Here’s a step-by-step guide to fix these problems and ensure smoother transitions between player states and rooms.

Step-by-Step Fix for obj_icetruck Destruction and Transition Crash:
1. Issue Analysis (Based on obj_icetruck_step.txt):
When the player interacts with the icetruck (E key press), the following happens:
The player (obj_player) is destroyed.
The obj_icetruck instance is destroyed.
A new instance of obj_player_icetruck is created.
Upon exiting the icetruck, the player returns, and the icetruck is recreated nearby.
Potential Problems:

Instance Timing:
instance_destroy() is called for both the player and the icetruck in the same frame. If the game references the destroyed icetruck afterward (like during a room transition), it can lead to crashes.
Instance Recreation:
Recreating the icetruck after exit could lead to duplicate instances if the timing or location is not managed properly.
2. Fix – Modify obj_icetruck Step Event (obj_icetruck_step.txt):
Goal: Ensure obj_icetruck is fully destroyed after interaction and doesn't linger or get referenced post-destruction.

Replace the Current Destruction Logic (Line 11-13) with:
gml
Copy code
// Destroy player and schedule ice truck destruction at the end of the frame
var truck_id = ice_truck.id;

alarm[0] = 1;  // Use alarm to delay icetruck destruction
global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
global.current_skin = "icetruck";

with (truck_id) {
    instance_deactivate_object(id); // Temporarily deactivate instead of destroy
}
3. Add the Following Code to obj_icetruck’s Alarm[0] Event:
gml
Copy code
with (id) {
    instance_destroy();
    show_debug_message("Icetruck instance destroyed by alarm.");
}
Why This Works:

instance_deactivate_object() prevents immediate destruction, avoiding reference issues during the current step.
instance_destroy() is delayed by 1 frame, allowing the game loop to safely complete without referencing the destroyed instance.
4. Modify Room Transition Logic (Optional, for Extra Safety):
In the Room End event of obj_icetruck, ensure all lingering instances are cleared:
gml
Copy code
with (self) {
    instance_destroy();
    show_debug_message("Icetruck destroyed during room end.");
}
5. Modify obj_player_icetruck Step Event (obj_player_icetruck_step.txt):
When switching back to obj_player, ensure that a new obj_icetruck is not accidentally duplicated.
Replace This Section (Line 17-21):
gml
Copy code
instance_create_layer(player_x + 32, player_y, "Instances", obj_icetruck);
With:

gml
Copy code
if (!instance_exists(obj_icetruck)) {
    instance_create_layer(player_x + 32, player_y, "Instances", obj_icetruck);
    show_debug_message("New icetruck created after exit.");
} else {
    show_debug_message("Icetruck already exists. Skipping recreation.");
}
6. Test the Changes:
Add debug messages to confirm the destruction process works correctly:
gml
Copy code
show_debug_message("Icetruck scheduled for destruction.");
Test room transitions, ensuring that the icetruck disappears without causing crashes.
Summary of Changes:
Delayed Destruction of obj_icetruck via an alarm prevents reference errors during the same frame.
Instance Check before recreating obj_icetruck avoids unnecessary duplicates.
Room End Cleanup ensures no lingering obj_icetruck instances persist after leaving the room.
Let me know if you need help implementing this directly into your GameMaker project.





You said:
In regards to step 5 I think your mistaken (instance_create_layer(player_x + 32, player_y, "Instances", obj_icetruck); ) doesnt show on Line 17-21, currently those lines represent this code in obj_player_icetruck (var right_key = keyboard_check(ord("D")) || keyboard_check(vk_right);
var left_key = keyboard_check(ord("A")) || keyboard_check(vk_left);
var up_key = keyboard_check(ord("W")) || keyboard_check(vk_up);
var down_key = keyboard_check(ord("S")) || keyboard_check(vk_down); )
ChatGPT said:

You're right! Thanks for pointing that out. Let's clarify step 5.

The line instance_create_layer(player_x + 32, player_y, "Instances", obj_icetruck); actually appears in the Step Event of obj_icetruck​, not obj_player_icetruck. This line is part of the exit process when switching back from obj_player_icetruck to obj_player.

Corrected Step 5 – Modify obj_icetruck Step Event (Exit Process):
Locate this section in obj_icetruck_step.txt:

gml
Copy code
instance_create_layer(player_x + 32, player_y, "Instances", obj_icetruck); // Re-create ice truck nearby
This occurs when the player exits the icetruck and returns to the normal player state.

Replace It With:
gml
Copy code
if (!instance_exists(obj_icetruck)) {
    instance_create_layer(player_x + 32, player_y, "Instances", obj_icetruck);
    show_debug_message("New icetruck created after exit.");
} else {
    show_debug_message("Icetruck already exists. Skipping recreation.");
}
Why This Change?
Prevents Duplicate Trucks: If an obj_icetruck still exists, the game won't spawn a new one, avoiding unnecessary duplicates.
Ensures Smooth Transition: If the previous obj_icetruck was destroyed properly, a new one is created without conflict.

ChatGPT said:

Thank you for the detailed clarification. Now that I see the full code for obj_player, obj_player_icetruck, and obj_controller, I understand how the switching between player states works.

Key Observations:
Switching Logic:
The skin switch between obj_player and obj_player_icetruck is fully handled by the switch_skin function in obj_controller.
This function ensures that the player instance is destroyed and recreated based on the target skin (player or icetruck).
Icetruck Recreation:
When switching back to the player (new_skin == "player"), the function destroys the obj_icetruck if it exists at the player’s location.
Potential Problem:
If the icetruck lingers after switching back to the player, the issue may stem from how or when the icetruck is destroyed.
The instance_place() in switch_skin only destroys obj_icetruck at the player’s exact coordinates. This can lead to missed destruction if the player slightly moves or if the icetruck's position shifts.
Fix – Prevent obj_icetruck from Lingering or Duplicating:
1. Modify the switch_skin Function (obj_controller):
Replace this section:

gml
Copy code
var ice_truck = instance_place(player_x, player_y, obj_icetruck);
if (ice_truck != noone) {
    instance_destroy(ice_truck);
}
With this more reliable approach:

gml
Copy code
with (obj_icetruck) {
    if (point_distance(x, y, player_x, player_y) < 40) {  // Destroy nearby icetruck
        instance_destroy();
        show_debug_message("Nearby icetruck destroyed.");
    }
}
Why This Works:
Instead of relying on instance_place(), we loop over all obj_icetruck instances and destroy those within a small radius of the player (40 pixels, adjustable).
This ensures that any lingering icetrucks close to the player are destroyed, even if their exact coordinates do not match.
2. Modify the Enter/Exit Logic in obj_icetruck (Optional Improvement):
In obj_icetruck_step.txt, locate this part:

gml
Copy code
instance_destroy(ice_truck);  // Remove ice truck
Replace it with:

gml
Copy code
alarm[0] = 1;  // Schedule destruction
Then, add this to the Alarm[0] Event in obj_icetruck:

gml
Copy code
instance_destroy();
show_debug_message("Icetruck destroyed by alarm.");
Why?

Delaying the destruction by 1 frame prevents potential race conditions that could cause crashes if the game references the icetruck immediately after instance_destroy().
3. Prevent Duplicate icetruck Instances:
Add a check before creating the icetruck when switching back to the player:
In obj_controller's switch_skin, modify the icetruck creation logic:

gml
Copy code
if (!instance_exists(obj_icetruck)) {
    instance_create_layer(player_x + 32, player_y, "Instances", obj_icetruck);
    show_debug_message("New icetruck created after exit.");
}
Testing and Debugging:
Run the game and watch the debug console for the message:
Nearby icetruck destroyed.
Test by switching between player and icetruck multiple times to ensure icetruck instances are not lingering or duplicating.
Summary of Changes:
Broader Destruction Radius: Ensures nearby icetrucks are destroyed even if they slightly move.
Delayed Destruction: Prevents crash scenarios by using alarms for safe instance cleanup.
Duplicate Prevention: Avoids creating multiple icetrucks by checking if one already exists.
Let me know if this resolves the lingering icetruck issue or if you'd like to adjust the code further!

Ive added your improvements and also uploaded the output log (titled debugoutput1.txt) so you can review it. The player was able to enter and exit the icetruck however the obj_icetruck remained in the room. I have also uploaded a much longer output log so you can hopefully review and get some insight as to why this isnt working (debugoutput3.txt)

The logs confirm that the player successfully enters and exits the icetruck, but the obj_icetruck instance persists in the room despite the code calling for its destruction.

Analysis from Logs (debugoutput3.txt):
The log shows the player switches to obj_player_icetruck successfully:
vbnet
Copy code
E key pressed
Switching to icetruck
obj_player_icetruck: Initialized. Player instance ID: ref instance 100413
Switched to icetruck. Player instance ID: ref instance 100413
On exit:
yaml
Copy code
obj_player: Initialized. Driving state: 0
Exited ice truck. Current skin: player
Player instance: ref instance 100414
However, the logs lack messages indicating that the icetruck instance is destroyed (e.g., no "Nearby icetruck destroyed" messages). This suggests the destruction logic may not trigger as expected.

Root Cause:
The instance_destroy() call inside the switch_skin function likely misses the icetruck instance because instance_place() only checks for an instance at the exact coordinates of the player. If the icetruck is even a few pixels off, it won't be detected and destroyed.

Fix - More Reliable Destruction of obj_icetruck:
In obj_controller, Update switch_skin Function:
Replace this part (responsible for destroying the icetruck):
gml
Copy code
var ice_truck = instance_place(player_x, player_y, obj_icetruck);
if (ice_truck != noone) {
    instance_destroy(ice_truck);
}
With:
gml
Copy code
with (obj_icetruck) {
    if (point_distance(x, y, player_x, player_y) < 40) {
        instance_destroy();
        show_debug_message("Icetruck destroyed by switch_skin.");
    }
}
Why This Works:

with (obj_icetruck) loops through all obj_icetruck instances in the room.
point_distance(x, y, player_x, player_y) < 40 ensures icetrucks within 40 pixels of the player are destroyed, fixing the precision issue.
Add a Debug Message to Verify Destruction:
gml
Copy code
show_debug_message("Icetruck destroyed at position: (" + string(x) + ", " + string(y) + ")");
This will log when an icetruck is destroyed, making it easier to track.

Optional - Safety Cleanup on Room End:
In obj_icetruck's Room End Event, ensure lingering instances are destroyed:
gml
Copy code
instance_destroy();
show_debug_message("Icetruck destroyed at room end.");
This adds an extra layer of cleanup in case the normal logic fails.

Testing:
Enter the icetruck, switch back to the player, and observe the debug console.
Look for Icetruck destroyed by switch_skin messages when exiting the icetruck.
If the message doesn't appear, adjust the point_distance() threshold to a higher value (e.g., 60).
Let me know if this fix resolves the lingering icetruck issue!

I have updated my code with your updates and ran a test. Ive provided the output log for you to review. When I started the game I entered the icetruck I then wasnt able to exit and switch back to the obj_player skin, when I entered a different room the game crashed

The log shows that the player successfully switches to the icetruck (obj_player_icetruck) but faces an issue exiting. The game eventually crashes during the room transition.

Key Observations:
Switch to Icetruck Works:

vbnet
Copy code
E key pressed
Switching to icetruck
obj_player_icetruck: Initialized. Player instance ID: ref instance 100414
Switched to icetruck. Player instance ID: ref instance 100414
The switch to the icetruck is logged, confirming the process initiates correctly.

Exit Attempt Logs Show No Icetruck Destruction:

csharp
Copy code
Switched to player. Player instance ID: ref instance 100414
The switch back to obj_player happens, but there is no log indicating icetruck destruction (Icetruck destroyed by switch_skin is missing).

No Alarm Destruction Triggered:

The lack of a debug message suggests the alarm[0] destruction path in obj_icetruck might not be triggering.
Crash on Room Transition:

arduino
Copy code
Room Start Event triggered in obj_controller.
Camera synchronized with player position after room transition.
This hints at potential dangling references to the obj_icetruck or a related resource.

Root Cause Analysis:
Destruction Logic Misses the Mark:
The instance_destroy might not be correctly locating the icetruck due to:
Position mismatch (coordinates slightly off).
The point_distance() condition might be too restrictive.
Possible Object Persistence:
The obj_icetruck may persist because instance_deactivate_object() is used without immediate destruction.
Fix – Improve Icetruck Destruction Reliability:
1. Modify switch_skin (obj_controller) to Destroy Icetruck More Effectively:
gml
Copy code
with (obj_icetruck) {
    instance_destroy();
    show_debug_message("Icetruck destroyed by switch_skin.");
}
Why This Change?
This ensures all instances of obj_icetruck are destroyed, bypassing the need for exact positional checks.
2. Enhance obj_icetruck Alarm[0] Event:
Add a fallback check to ensure the icetruck is destroyed even if the alarm fails:
gml
Copy code
if (instance_exists(id)) {
    instance_destroy();
    show_debug_message("Icetruck destroyed by Alarm[0].");
}
3. Modify obj_icetruck Room End Event (Failsafe Cleanup):
gml
Copy code
with (self) {
    instance_destroy();
    show_debug_message("Icetruck destroyed during Room End.");
}
This serves as a last line of defense to clean up lingering instances during room transitions.
Testing Steps:
Add debug messages for each destruction path.
Enter and exit the icetruck multiple times, watching for:
csharp
Copy code
Icetruck destroyed by switch_skin.
Icetruck destroyed by Alarm[0].
Trigger a room transition and ensure:
mathematica
Copy code
Icetruck destroyed during Room End.
If the Crash Persists:
There may be references to the destroyed icetruck in other objects or scripts.
Perform a search for obj_icetruck across the project to locate any unintended references post-destruction.
Let me know if this helps or if further troubleshooting is needed!

I followed your intructions and added the revised code, I also uploaded the output log (debugoutput1.txt). Im beginning to wonder if something else is interferring. Im beginning to think the issue is how ive copied and pasted your suggested code into my game. Can you give me intructions how fix the error by showing me the entire step event code in a format I can easily copy and assure Im not putting code in the wrong place?

The output log shows that the player successfully switches between obj_player and obj_player_icetruck, but the key issue persists—there are no logs indicating that the icetruck is destroyed. This suggests that the icetruck destruction logic might not be properly executed.

Step-by-Step Fix (Full Code Implementation):
Below is a complete and structured version of the key events to ensure the code is correctly placed and easy to copy into GameMaker.

1. obj_controller - Step Event:
This is the core function handling the switch between obj_player and obj_player_icetruck.
Replace the existing switch_skin function with this:

gml
Copy code
// Step Event for obj_controller
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
    var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

    // Destroy current player instance if it exists
    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    }

    // Switch to icetruck
    if (new_skin == "icetruck") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
        global.current_skin = "icetruck";
        global.icetruck_destroyed = false;
        show_debug_message("Switched to icetruck. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    
    // Switch to player
    } else if (new_skin == "player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
        
        // Destroy icetruck if it exists nearby
        with (obj_icetruck) {
            if (point_distance(x, y, player_x, player_y) < 50) {  // Increase the radius if necessary
                instance_destroy();
                show_debug_message("Icetruck destroyed by switch_skin at: (" + string(x) + ", " + string(y) + ")");
            }
        }

        global.current_skin = "player";
        show_debug_message("Switched to player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    }
}

// Ensure the camera follows the player
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    var view_x = clamp(global.player_instance.x - (view_wview[0] / 2), 0, room_width - view_wview[0]);
    var view_y = clamp(global.player_instance.y - (view_hview[0] / 2), 0, room_height - view_hview[0]);
    view_xview[0] = view_x;
    view_yview[0] = view_y;
    view_object[0] = global.player_instance;

    show_debug_message("Camera at: (" + string(view_xview[0]) + ", " + string(view_yview[0]) + ")");
}
2. obj_icetruck - Alarm[0] Event (Destroy Timer):
This ensures the icetruck is destroyed a frame after switching to obj_player.

gml
Copy code
// Alarm[0] Event
if (instance_exists(id)) {
    instance_destroy();
    show_debug_message("Icetruck destroyed by Alarm[0] at: (" + string(x) + ", " + string(y) + ")");
}
3. obj_icetruck - Room End Event (Failsafe Destruction):
Add this event to ensure obj_icetruck is destroyed when transitioning rooms.

gml
Copy code
// Room End Event
with (self) {
    instance_destroy();
    show_debug_message("Icetruck destroyed during Room End.");
}
4. obj_player_icetruck - Step Event:
Handles the switch logic when pressing E to exit the icetruck.

gml
Copy code
// Step Event for obj_player_icetruck
if (keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {
    show_debug_message("E key pressed");

    if (global.current_skin == "icetruck") {
        show_debug_message("Switching to player");
        obj_controller.switch_skin("player");
    }
}

// Handle Movement
var right_key = keyboard_check(ord("D")) || keyboard_check(vk_right);
var left_key = keyboard_check(ord("A")) || keyboard_check(vk_left);
var up_key = keyboard_check(ord("W")) || keyboard_check(vk_up);
var down_key = keyboard_check(ord("S")) || keyboard_check(vk_down);

xspd = (right_key - left_key) * move_spd;
yspd = (down_key - up_key) * move_spd;

x += xspd;
y += yspd;

// Layering
depth = -bbox_bottom;
5. obj_player - Step Event (Normal Player):
Similar to obj_player_icetruck, this handles switching to the icetruck.

gml
Copy code
// Step Event for obj_player
if (keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {
    show_debug_message("E key pressed");

    if (global.current_skin == "player") {
        show_debug_message("Switching to icetruck");
        obj_controller.switch_skin("icetruck");
    }
}
Testing and Debugging:
Check for Destruction Messages
After applying this code, run the game and watch the debug console for:

vbnet
Copy code
Icetruck destroyed by switch_skin at: (x, y)
Icetruck destroyed by Alarm[0] at: (x, y)
Icetruck destroyed during Room End.
Modify Distance Threshold (if necessary):
If the icetruck is not destroyed, increase the point_distance() check from 50 to 100 or more in switch_skin().

Force Cleanup (Debugging Only):
As a last resort, add this to obj_controller temporarily to manually destroy all icetrucks:

gml
Copy code
with (obj_icetruck) {
    instance_destroy();
    show_debug_message("Manually destroyed lingering icetruck.");
}
Why This Should Work:
The logic ensures that obj_icetruck is checked for destruction under multiple conditions:

Switching Skins (Immediate)
Alarm (Delayed by 1 Frame)
Room Transition (Failsafe)
The debug messages provide real-time feedback to track the icetruck destruction process, allowing easier pinpointing of failures.

Let me know if the icetruck still persists or if the crash on room transition continues!

ok so we are making progress, however now the obj_player is contantly playing walking animation (I only wanted this to be the case when as obj_player_icetruck) The obj_icetruck destruction is so extensive that it also destroys the obj_icetruck that should spawn when the player exits the ice truck and switches back to the player skin. Finally in the debugoutput1.txt when I entered a different room the game crashed. I currently have rm_init with obj_controller and obj_camera in the room. rm_init creation code is (global.player_start_x = 151; // Desired X coordinate 
global.player_start_y = 159; // Desired Y coordinate

room_goto_next(); ) and the next room is the starter room (called rm_welcome_room) with obj_controller, obj camera, obj_icetruck and obj_intializer. The second room only has obj_controller and obj_camera. Im curious if that is correct.

The logs confirm the switch between obj_player and obj_player_icetruck works, but issues persist with the following:

Walking Animation Constantly Playing for obj_player – This happens even when the player isn't moving.
Over-destruction of obj_icetruck – When switching back to obj_player, the icetruck that should spawn is also destroyed.
Room Transition Crash – Likely due to missing objects or incorrect initialization.
Fixing the Walking Animation Issue:
Problem:
obj_player continuously plays the walking animation, possibly because movement speed variables (xspd/yspd) aren't properly reset to 0 when not moving.

Solution for obj_player Step Event:
Update obj_player's Step Event to ensure the walking animation only plays when the player is moving.

Full Code for obj_player Step Event:
gml
Copy code
// Step Event for obj_player
if (keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {
    show_debug_message("E key pressed");

    if (global.current_skin == "player") {
        show_debug_message("Switching to icetruck");
        obj_controller.switch_skin("icetruck");
    }
}

// Handle movement
var right_key = keyboard_check(ord("D")) || keyboard_check(vk_right);
var left_key = keyboard_check(ord("A")) || keyboard_check(vk_left);
var up_key = keyboard_check(ord("W")) || keyboard_check(vk_up);
var down_key = keyboard_check(ord("S")) || keyboard_check(vk_down);

// Get xspd & yspd
xspd = (right_key - left_key) * move_spd;
yspd = (down_key - up_key) * move_spd;

// Pause if obj_pauser exists
if (instance_exists(obj_pauser)) {
    xspd = 0;
    yspd = 0;
}

// Prevent animation loop if not moving
if (xspd == 0 && yspd == 0) {
    image_index = 0;  // Reset animation to idle
    show_debug_message("Player is idle.");
} else {
    show_debug_message("Player is moving.");
}

// Movement and Collisions
if (!place_meeting(x + xspd, y, obj_wall)) {
    x += xspd;
}
if (!place_meeting(x, y + yspd, obj_wall)) {
    y += yspd;
}

// Depth and Sprite Control
depth = -bbox_bottom;
sprite_index = sprite[face];
Why This Works:
Stops Animation When Idle: The image_index = 0 resets the sprite to the first frame when the player isn't moving.
Prevents Excess Animation Loops: Movement logic only updates when xspd or yspd is non-zero.
Fixing Icetruck Destruction on Player Switch:
Problem:
The icetruck created after switching back to obj_player is also being destroyed due to the broad with (obj_icetruck) destruction.

Solution in obj_controller (switch_skin Function):
Modify the part of switch_skin responsible for destroying the icetruck:

gml
Copy code
with (obj_icetruck) {
    if (point_distance(x, y, player_x, player_y) < 50 && global.current_skin == "icetruck") {
        instance_destroy();
        show_debug_message("Icetruck destroyed by switch_skin at: (" + string(x) + ", " + string(y) + ")");
    }
}
Why This Works:
Prevents Over-destruction:
The icetruck is only destroyed when the player is switching from the icetruck (global.current_skin == "icetruck").
After switching back to obj_player, the icetruck respawn won't trigger destruction.
Fixing Room Transition Crash:
Problem:
The crash may stem from missing objects (obj_controller, obj_camera) or improper initialization when transitioning rooms.

Solution – Room Setup Check:
Ensure obj_controller and obj_camera exist in each room.
Add Initialization in obj_controller's Room Start Event:
gml
Copy code
// Room Start Event for obj_controller
if (!instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(global.player_start_x, global.player_start_y, "Instances", obj_player);
    show_debug_message("Player instance created at room start.");
}

// Ensure camera follows player
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    view_object[0] = global.player_instance;
    show_debug_message("Camera synchronized with player position after room transition.");
}
Why This Works:
Creates a Player if Missing: Prevents crashes by ensuring a player instance is created if none exists.
Syncs Camera: Keeps the camera locked on the player even after room transitions.
Testing Checklist:
Test Movement: Verify the player stops animating when idle and resumes when moving.
Switching Skins: Ensure obj_icetruck is destroyed properly when switching to the player but persists when switching from the player.
Room Transition: Confirm no crashes during room changes by ensuring obj_player and obj_camera are present and initialized.
Let me know if the crash persists or if further adjustments are needed!

Please reveiw the .txt file; All previous bus are still present. the platers 8 directions walking sprites to be used. ive uploaded the create events for you to reference. the first obj_icetruck is removed correctly however when the player exits no obj_icetruck is placed near the player when the skin switches. It also seems like the player is able to switch back and forth when pressing the interact button. The game also crashed when entering a different room as obj_player_icetruck.

Here's a breakdown of the issues based on the logs and object creation code:

Identified Problems:
Icetruck Not Respawning After Exiting:
The logs indicate that while the initial icetruck is destroyed correctly, no new icetruck spawns when the player exits.
The problem lies in the switching logic that doesn't handle icetruck recreation properly.
Room Transition Crash:
The crash likely happens because the player transitions into a room without a valid player instance or camera setup.
Player Movement and Animation (obj_player and obj_player_icetruck):
obj_player constantly animates, even when stationary.
Fixes and Code Implementation:
1. Fix Icetruck Respawn After Exiting:
Modify the switch_skin function in obj_controller.

This ensures the icetruck spawns near the player when switching back to the normal player skin.
gml
Copy code
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
    var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

    // Destroy the current player instance
    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    }

    // Switch to the icetruck
    if (new_skin == "icetruck") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
        global.current_skin = "icetruck";
        show_debug_message("Switched to icetruck. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    
    // Switch to the player and respawn icetruck nearby
    } else if (new_skin == "player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
        global.current_skin = "player";
        
        // Spawn icetruck next to the player
        if (!instance_exists(obj_icetruck)) {
            instance_create_layer(player_x + 32, player_y, "Instances", obj_icetruck);
            show_debug_message("Icetruck respawned near player at: (" + string(player_x + 32) + ", " + string(player_y) + ")");
        }
    }
}
2. Room Transition Safety (obj_controller - Room Start Event):
Ensure a player instance exists when entering a new room to avoid crashes.

Add this to the Room Start Event of obj_controller:

gml
Copy code
if (!instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(global.player_start_x, global.player_start_y, "Instances", obj_player);
    show_debug_message("Player instance recreated during room transition.");
}

// Ensure camera follows player
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    view_object[0] = global.player_instance;
}
3. Stop obj_player from Constantly Animating (obj_player Step Event):
Add logic to prevent idle animation loops:

gml
Copy code
if (xspd == 0 && yspd == 0) {
    image_index = 0;
    show_debug_message("Player idle. Animation reset.");
} else {
    show_debug_message("Player moving.");
}
4. Ensure icetruck Isn't Over-Destroyed:
Modify the icetruck destruction logic to avoid over-destruction when switching back to obj_player.

In switch_skin, replace this:

gml
Copy code
with (obj_icetruck) {
    if (point_distance(x, y, player_x, player_y) < 50) {
        instance_destroy();
        show_debug_message("Icetruck destroyed by switch_skin at: (" + string(x) + ", " + string(y) + ")");
    }
}
With:

gml
Copy code
with (obj_icetruck) {
    if (point_distance(x, y, player_x, player_y) < 50 && global.current_skin == "icetruck") {
        instance_destroy();
        show_debug_message("Icetruck destroyed when switching from icetruck.");
    }
}
5. Create Event Logic (Summarized for Reference):
obj_player (obj_player_create.txt):

Core movement and sliding logic is initialized here.
Ensure move_spd is set correctly:
gml
Copy code
move_spd = 2;
obj_player_icetruck (obj_player_icetruck_create.txt):

Movement and sprites for obj_player_icetruck are initialized with:
gml
Copy code
move_spd = 4;
obj_controller (obj_controller_create.txt):

Global initialization and player instantiation happens in obj_controller:
gml
Copy code
global.current_skin = "player";
global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(x, y, "Instances", obj_player);
Testing Checklist:
Entering and Exiting Icetruck:
Verify the player can enter the icetruck (E key).
Ensure the icetruck respawns next to the player when exiting.
Room Transition:
Transition between rooms while in both obj_player and obj_player_icetruck states.
Ensure the player or icetruck spawns correctly without crashing.
Idle Animation Check:
Confirm the player sprite resets when idle.
Let me know if further refinements are needed or if the crash persists!

ChatGPT said:

The crash is caused by this line in obj_controller's Step Event:

csharp
Copy code
if (point_distance(x, y, player_x, player_y) < 50 && global.current_skin == "icetruck") {
The error indicates that player_y was not set before being read, which means the player instance's x and y values (player_x and player_y) are undefined.

Root Cause:
Missing Player Reference:
The crash happens because player_x and player_y are derived from global.player_instance, but at the time this line executes, global.player_instance either doesn't exist or hasn't been initialized correctly.
Race Condition:
obj_controller might be attempting to reference the player’s position before the player instance finishes initializing.
Fix – Ensure player_x and player_y Are Always Valid:
Modify the Step Event in obj_controller (around line 30):

gml
Copy code
// Ensure global.player_instance exists and has valid coordinates
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
    var player_y = global.player_instance.y;
    
    // Destroy nearby icetruck when switching back to player

        if (point_distance(x, y, player_x, player_y) < 50 && global.current_skin == "icetruck") {
            instance_destroy();
            show_debug_message("Icetruck destroyed by switch_skin at: (" + string(x) + ", " + string(y) + ")");
        }
    }
} else {
    show_debug_message("Warning: player_instance does not exist during Step Event.");
}
Why This Works:
Instance Check: The instance_exists check prevents the crash by ensuring global.player_instance exists before trying to read its x and y values.
Fallback Debug Message: If the player doesn't exist during the step, the debug message warns you, allowing you to track the issue.
Additional Safeguards – Create Player if Missing (Failsafe):
Add the following to the Room Start Event in obj_controller to ensure a player instance is created if it doesn't exist:

gml
Copy code
if (!instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(global.player_start_x, global.player_start_y, "Instances", obj_player);
    show_debug_message("Player instance recreated during Room Start.");
}
Testing:
Launch the game and monitor the console.
If the warning message about missing player_instance appears, it indicates that the player isn't being created early enough.
If the crash persists, try increasing the debug output by adding:
gml
Copy code
show_debug_message("player_x: " + string(global.player_instance.x) + ", player_y: " + string(global.player_instance.y));
Ensure global.player_start_x and global.player_start_y are properly initialized in the room creation code.
Why the Crash Happens on Startup:
The game likely starts in a room (rm_init) that relies on transitioning to another room immediately (rm_welcome_room). If the player isn't properly instantiated before the transition completes, player_x and player_y will remain undefined.
Let me know how the changes affect the game or if further issues arise!

This the latest debug output for you to review more things keep breaking, now the camera doesnt follow the player properly and interacting with obj_icetruck no longer switches obj_player to obj_player_icetruck

Analysis of Debug Output (Key Issues Identified):
Camera Not Following the Player Properly:
The camera consistently stays at (0, 52), indicating that the camera isn't properly attached to the player instance.
Viewport object: 100413 confirms the player is being instantiated, but the camera isn’t updating as the player moves.
Icetruck Interaction Not Switching Player Skin to obj_player_icetruck:
No debug messages related to switching to obj_player_icetruck appear, suggesting that the interaction logic isn’t firing.
Root Causes and Fixes:
1. Camera Not Following the Player:
Problem:

The camera seems stuck at (0, 52). This suggests that the viewport isn’t updating based on the player's position.
Solution:

Ensure the camera is consistently attached to global.player_instance in the Step Event of obj_controller or obj_camera.
Fix for obj_controller (Step Event):

gml
Copy code
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    var view_x = clamp(global.player_instance.x - (view_wview[0] / 2), 0, room_width - view_wview[0]);
    var view_y = clamp(global.player_instance.y - (view_hview[0] / 2), 0, room_height - view_hview[0]);
    
    view_xview[0] = view_x;
    view_yview[0] = view_y;

    view_object[0] = global.player_instance;
    show_debug_message("Camera updated to player position: (" + string(view_xview[0]) + ", " + string(view_yview[0]) + ")");
} else {
    show_debug_message("Warning: Player instance does not exist. Camera not updated.");
}
2. Icetruck Interaction Not Switching Skins:
Problem:

The player doesn't switch to obj_player_icetruck when interacting with the icetruck.
This likely indicates an issue in the logic that triggers the switch.
Fix for obj_icetruck (Left Pressed or Interact Event):
Ensure the switch is triggered when interacting with obj_icetruck.

gml
Copy code
if (global.current_skin == "player") {
    show_debug_message("Switching to icetruck.");
    obj_controller.switch_skin("icetruck");
} else {
    show_debug_message("Already in icetruck. No switch needed.");
}
3. Create Event Fix (Ensure Initialization):
If the player or icetruck isn't initializing correctly, add this to obj_controller's Create Event:

gml
Copy code
if (!instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(global.player_start_x, global.player_start_y, "Instances", obj_player);
    global.current_skin = "player";
    show_debug_message("Player instance created at start: (" + string(global.player_start_x) + ", " + string(global.player_start_y) + ")");
}
Testing and Debugging:
Start the game and monitor the debug console. Look for:
css
Copy code
Camera updated to player position
Switching to icetruck
If the camera doesn’t update or the switch doesn’t trigger, verify the following:
obj_controller is present in all rooms.
obj_icetruck interaction correctly references obj_controller.switch_skin().
Let me know if these adjustments resolve the issues or if further debugging is needed!

ChatGPT said:

Thank you for sharing the full step event code for obj_icetruck. The logic is mostly in place, but there are a few adjustments needed to ensure the interaction works consistently and prevents issues like multiple icetruck instances or missed transitions.

Key Issues with Current Code:
Interaction Condition Issue:
instance_place(global.player_instance.x, global.player_instance.y, obj_icetruck) may fail if the player's position slightly shifts away from the icetruck.
This strict positional check can prevent entering/exiting the icetruck properly.
Recreation of obj_icetruck (Duplication Risk):
When exiting the icetruck, the line:
gml
Copy code
instance_create_layer(player_x + 32, player_y, "Instances", obj_icetruck);
can lead to duplicates if the previous obj_icetruck isn't destroyed correctly.
Camera Update Issue:
The smooth camera logic works well but may cause issues if global.player_instance doesn't exist or has incorrect references.
Fixes and Full Revised Step Event for obj_icetruck:
Here’s a more refined and structured version of the step event for obj_icetruck:

gml
Copy code
// Step Event for obj_icetruck

// Interact with icetruck using 'E' key
if (keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {
    // Ensure player instance exists
    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
        var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

        // ENTER the icetruck (Switch to obj_player_icetruck)
        if (global.current_skin == "player") {
            show_debug_message("Switching to icetruck...");

            instance_destroy(global.player_instance); // Remove player
            alarm[0] = 1;  // Delay icetruck destruction by 1 frame

            global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
            global.current_skin = "icetruck";

            show_debug_message("Entered ice truck. Current skin: " + global.current_skin);

        // EXIT the icetruck (Switch to obj_player)
        } else if (global.current_skin == "icetruck") {
            show_debug_message("Exiting icetruck...");

            instance_destroy(global.player_instance); // Remove icetruck player
            global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);

            // Recreate the icetruck nearby if it doesn't already exist
            if (!instance_exists(obj_icetruck)) {
                instance_create_layer(player_x + 32, player_y, "Instances", obj_icetruck);
                show_debug_message("Recreated icetruck near player.");
            }

            global.current_skin = "player";
            show_debug_message("Exited ice truck. Current skin: " + global.current_skin);
        }
    } else {
        show_debug_message("Error: player_instance not found during interaction.");
    }
}

// Smooth camera movement to follow the player
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    var target_x = global.player_instance.x - (camera_get_view_width(global.camera) / 2);
    var target_y = global.player_instance.y - (camera_get_view_height(global.camera) / 2);

    // Clamp within room bounds
    target_x = clamp(target_x, 0, room_width - camera_get_view_width(global.camera));
    target_y = clamp(target_y, 0, room_height - camera_get_view_height(global.camera));

    // Smooth movement
    var current_x = camera_get_view_x(global.camera);
    var current_y = camera_get_view_y(global.camera);

    var smooth_x = lerp(current_x, target_x, 0.1);
    var smooth_y = lerp(current_y, target_y, 0.1);

    camera_set_view_pos(global.camera, smooth_x, smooth_y);
} else {
    show_debug_message("Warning: player_instance does not exist during camera update.");
}

// Display interaction message if player is nearby
if (distance_to_object(global.player_instance) < 32 && global.current_skin == "player") {
    draw_text(x, y - 20, "Press 'E' to enter");
}

// Ensure depth is properly adjusted for sorting
depth = -bbox_bottom;

// Debugging messages
show_debug_message("Player instance: " + string(global.player_instance));
show_debug_message("Viewport object: " + string(view_object[0]));
show_debug_message("Viewport position: (" + string(view_xview[0]) + ", " + string(view_yview[0]) + ")");
Explanation of Changes:
Position Check Removed:
Instead of relying on instance_place(), I used a simple instance check (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) to confirm the player exists. This avoids issues with slight positional misalignments.
Prevent Icetruck Duplication:
Before creating a new icetruck when exiting, the code checks if obj_icetruck already exists using:
gml
Copy code
if (!instance_exists(obj_icetruck))
This avoids unnecessary duplication.
Camera Update Fallback:
If global.player_instance doesn’t exist during the camera update, a debug message is logged instead of causing a crash.
Interaction Feedback:
If the player instance doesn’t exist during interaction, a debug message appears to help diagnose the issue.
Testing the Fixes:
Run the game and interact with the icetruck.
Check the Debug Console for messages like:
css
Copy code
Switching to icetruck...
Entered ice truck. Current skin: icetruck
Exiting icetruck...
Recreated icetruck near player.
Transition between rooms and ensure the icetruck interaction works as expected.
Let me know if the icetruck switching works or if further adjustments are needed!

You need to take a serious lookback on all the changes that has led us to the point, check the output file. The camera viewport has stopped following the player, when the player interacts with the obj_icetruck it disappears but the obj_player doesnt switch to the obj_player_icetruck. obj_player_icetruck is drawn into the room however both obj_player and obj_player_icetruck are both being controlled by the player, when the player presses the interact button (which is "E" by the way) the obj_controller doesnt change the obj_player_icetruck back to obj_player and draw an obj_icetruck into the room facing the direction the player was when exiting. The obj_controller was supposed to handle the camera movement and the skin switching logic. Please have a serious think about how fix everything

Based on the debug log, the primary issues are:

Camera Not Following the Player Properly:
The camera consistently stays at (0, 52). This suggests that the camera isn’t dynamically updating to follow the player.
**Player and Icet
ruck Both Being Controlled After Switching:**

After interacting with the icetruck, both obj_player and obj_player_icetruck are controlled simultaneously. This indicates that the player instance isn’t being destroyed correctly or the icetruck switching logic isn't working as expected.
Icetruck Not Respawning Correctly After Exiting:
When exiting the icetruck, the expected behavior of creating a new obj_icetruck at the player’s location is not occurring.
Fixing the Camera Issue (obj_controller Step Event):
The camera appears to lock in place because it might not be properly assigned to follow the player instance after switching skins. We need to ensure the camera consistently follows global.player_instance.

Modify the camera-following logic in the obj_controller Step Event:

gml
Copy code
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    var view_x = clamp(global.player_instance.x - (view_wview[0] / 2), 0, room_width - view_wview[0]);
    var view_y = clamp(global.player_instance.y - (view_hview[0] / 2), 0, room_height - view_hview[0]);

    view_xview[0] = view_x;
    view_yview[0] = view_y;

    view_object[0] = global.player_instance;
    show_debug_message("Camera updated to follow player at: (" + string(view_xview[0]) + ", " + string(view_yview[0]) + ")");
} else {
    show_debug_message("Warning: No player instance found during camera update.");
}
Handling the Player and Icetruck Control Conflict:
Problem:
The game is creating obj_player_icetruck but isn’t destroying obj_player, causing both to exist and be controlled at the same time.

Solution:
Ensure that when the player enters the icetruck, the original obj_player is destroyed immediately.

Fix for obj_icetruck (Interaction with "E" Key):

gml
Copy code
if (keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {
    if (global.current_skin == "player") {
        show_debug_message("Switching to icetruck...");

        var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
        var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

        // Destroy the player instance
        instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
        
        // Create the icetruck version of the player
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
        global.current_skin = "icetruck";

        show_debug_message("Entered icetruck. Skin switched to icetruck.");
    }
}
Fixing Icetruck Respawn After Exiting:
When the player exits the icetruck, the new obj_icetruck should spawn near the player.
However, if the previous icetruck is destroyed, this logic must ensure no duplicates are created.

Modify obj_player_icetruck (Switching Back to Player Logic):

gml
Copy code
if (keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {
    if (global.current_skin == "icetruck") {
        show_debug_message("Exiting icetruck...");

        var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
        var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

        instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
        
        // Create player instance and respawn icetruck
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
        
        // Check and ensure icetruck is recreated at the player's location
        if (!instance_exists(obj_icetruck)) {
            instance_create_layer(player_x + 32, player_y, "Instances", obj_icetruck);
            show_debug_message("Icetruck respawned next to player.");
        }

        global.current_skin = "player";
        show_debug_message("Exited icetruck. Skin switched to player.");
    }
}
Ensuring Smooth Room Transitions:
In the Room Start Event for obj_controller:

gml
Copy code
if (!instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(global.player_start_x, global.player_start_y, "Instances", obj_player);
    global.current_skin = "player";
    show_debug_message("Player instance recreated during room start.");
}

// Reattach camera to player after room change
view_object[0] = global.player_instance;
show_debug_message("Camera reassigned to player after room transition.");
Testing Checklist:
Start the game and interact with the icetruck:
Confirm the obj_player is destroyed when switching to obj_player_icetruck.
Check that only one player object exists at any time.
Exit the icetruck by pressing "E":
Ensure the player switches back to obj_player and a new obj_icetruck appears at the exit point.
Transition between rooms:
Confirm the camera reattaches to the player instance.
Observe the Debug Console:
Look for messages like:
vbnet
Copy code
Switching to icetruck...
Entered icetruck. Skin switched to icetruck.
Exiting icetruck...
Icetruck respawned next to player.
Let me know if the camera or icetruck switching logic still causes issues. We can fine-tune the detection or instance management further if needed!
