I am working on a game in gamemaker, I have exported every .gml file relating to each object and their folder in my project into a .txt file. I have included the current directory and name of each file the code was transcribed from. Ive compiled this data for you to analyse. I want to get an overview of the current systems present in my game. Each file contains every singles object event code so reading both documents is essential to understanding each system and their interlinking logic that makes everything work. I want you to then briefly explain each gameplay element and their purpose in relationship to other objects. After this analysis I want a report on the code itself. If theres any overlapping or redundant code present. If their are better or more efficient ways of having things set up or code used. Please explore all options this is purely a brainstorming, idea session. No ideas are bad ideas.

Game System Overview & Object Interconnections
Your game appears to be a 2D adventure/simulation with multiple gameplay elements interacting seamlessly. Below is a breakdown of the key systems present in your GameMaker project:

1. Camera System (obj_camera)
Purpose: Manages camera movement and follows the player.
Key Features:
Attaches to global.player_instance to ensure the camera tracks movement.
Restores camera settings after room transitions.
Prevents movement if no player instance exists, retrying every 2 frames.
Connections:
Relies on obj_player and global.camera for tracking.
Used in UI rooms (rm_pause_menu, rm_map) where it remains fixed.
2. Player System (obj_controller, obj_player)
Purpose: Controls the main player and its various forms (skins, vehicles).
Key Features:
Stores and spawns player instances using global.current_skin.
Handles player instance recreation when returning from menu/UI rooms.
Includes a skin-switching system (switch_skin()) allowing players to transform into different avatars (icetruck, sled, ninja, etc.).
Connections:
obj_camera follows global.player_instance.
obj_controller spawns and reattaches the player.
Interacts with obj_pause_menu and obj_color_wheel for customization.
3. Dialogue & Chat System (obj_chat_window)
Purpose: Provides in-game dialogue and NPC interactions.
Key Features:
Uses dialog_queue[] to store and advance conversations.
Blocks certain game actions (e.g., prevents map interaction).
Supports simple choice-based dialogues.
Connections:
NPC interactions (obj_npc).
UI elements (obj_map, obj_menu_button) to block actions when chat is active.
4. NPC & Quest System (obj_npc)
Purpose: Handles NPCs with quests and interactions.
Key Features:
Stores dialogue[] for each NPC.
Can give out quests with quest_given, quest_required_item, and quest_reward.
Stops player movement when engaging in dialogue.
Connections:
Uses obj_chat_window to display conversations.
Interacts with obj_inventory to check if the player has the required quest items.
5. Vehicle System (obj_icetruck)
Purpose: Allows players to drive a vehicle under certain conditions.
Key Features:
Spawns a player_icetruck instance when entered.
Requires repair before use (repair_required flag).
Connections:
Interacts with obj_player (destroys player instance when entering the truck).
Spawns a new player instance when exiting.
6. UI & Menu System (obj_pause_menu, obj_main_settings)
Purpose: Handles pause menu, settings, and interactions.
Key Features:
Prevents player movement when open.
Options include changing skins, colors, adjusting settings, and quitting the game.
Connections:
Pauses gameplay (prevents movement updates in obj_player and obj_npc).
Allows interaction with obj_color_wheel for player customization.
7. Map & Room Transition System (obj_map, obj_map_icon)
Purpose: Allows travel between different in-game areas.
Key Features:
Displays a map with interactive regions (rm_beach, rm_town, etc.).
Saves and restores the player’s position when transitioning rooms.
Connections:
Uses room_goto() to switch locations.
Blocks interaction when global.chat_active = true.
8. Music & Sound System (obj_musicmanager)
Purpose: Handles background music and smooth transitions.
Key Features:
Uses a fade-in/fade-out system for seamless audio transitions.
Adjusts volume dynamically (global.musicVolume, global.masterVolume).
Connections:
Changes music depending on the current room.
Uses set_song_ingame() to play different tracks.
9. Obstacle & Environment System (obj_obstacle, obj_obstacle_controller)
Purpose: Generates obstacles that move upwards (possibly for a mini-game or race).
Key Features:
Spawns obstacles at a set interval.
Resets their position when out of bounds.
Connections:
Uses an alarm system to continuously spawn new obstacles.
Tied to global.game_started (only moves when the game is active).
10. Parallax Background System (obj_parallax_background)
Purpose: Creates a layered scrolling effect in the background.
Key Features:
Moves background layers at different speeds (_p = 0.5).
Connections:
Uses camera_get_view_x/y() to adjust the scroll speed dynamically.
Code Efficiency & Redundancy Analysis
Now, let's examine ways to optimize or refactor the code.

1. Player Skin System (switch_skin())
Issue: Overly complex if-else structure.
Instead of checking for each skin manually, store skins in a map (dictionary) or iterate over global.skins[].

Improvement:
gml
Copy
Edit
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    if (global.skin_switching) return;
    global.skin_switching = true;

    var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
    var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) instance_destroy(global.player_instance);

    // Use map-based lookup instead of multiple if-statements
    var new_instance = noone;
    for (var i = 0; i < array_length(global.skins); i++) {
        if (global.skins[i].name == new_skin) {
            new_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", global.skins[i].object);
            global.current_skin = new_skin;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (new_instance == noone) {
        new_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
        global.current_skin = "player";
    }

    global.player_instance = new_instance;
    camera_set_view_target(view_camera[0], global.player_instance);
    global.skin_switching = false;
}
✅ Benefits: Removes redundant checks, makes it easier to add future skins.

2. Camera System (obj_camera)
Issue: Multiple instances of camera_create() in different events.
Creating the camera in both Create_0.gml and Room Start Event leads to unnecessary duplication.
Improvement:
Store a single camera reference in global.camera.
Modify obj_initializer to ensure the camera is created once.
3. NPC Dialogue System (obj_npc)
Issue: Overuse of manual string manipulation for quests.
Each NPC manually checks for quest_given and quest_reward, leading to code repetition.
Improvement:
Create a universal dialogue system that automatically handles quest progression:
gml
Copy
Edit
function advance_dialogue(npc) {
    if (npc.current_dialogue_index < array_length(npc.dialogue) - 1) {
        npc.current_dialogue_index++;
    } else {
        npc.current_dialogue_index = -1;

        if (npc.is_quest_giver && !npc.quest_given) {
            give_quest(npc);
        }
    }
}

function give_quest(npc) {
    npc.quest_given = true;
    if (instance_exists(obj_inventory)) {
        obj_inventory.add_to_inventory(npc.quest_reward);
    }
}
✅ Benefits: Makes it easier to add new NPCs and quests without copy-pasting logic.

Final Thoughts & Next Steps
Your game has well-structured and functional systems, but here are five key areas for improvement:

Refactor the player skin system to avoid excessive if-else statements.
Streamline camera creation by ensuring it only initializes once.
Improve the NPC dialogue system to reduce repetitive logic.
Optimize obstacle spawning by adjusting the alarm timing dynamically.
Implement a UI manager object to centralize UI-related logic (obj_pause_menu, obj_main_settings).
Would you like me to generate a refactored version of some of these scripts for implementation? 🚀

Document
I have also combined every script code into one document, please review then revise any areas for improvement and begin refactoring and generating improved code. I want you to format your response so that I can easily and quickly copy your updated code into my project. Please provide simple step by step easy to follow instructions.
Refactored & Optimized Code for Your GameMaker Project
I've reviewed all scripts and implemented improvements for efficiency, readability, and maintainability. Below are step-by-step instructions for updating your code.

Step 1: Update Your Camera System
Issue: Multiple redundant camera setup calls across events.
Fix: Centralize camera creation & setup into a single script.
New Camera Initialization Script (scr_init_camera.gml)
Replace all individual camera creation calls with this function:

gml
Copy
Edit
/// scr_init_camera()
/// Ensures a single instance of the camera exists & follows the player.

function scr_init_camera() {
    if (!variable_global_exists("camera") || !is_real(global.camera)) {
        global.camera = camera_create();
        camera_set_view_size(global.camera, view_wview[0], view_hview[0]);
        view_camera[0] = global.camera;
        show_debug_message("New global camera created.");
    }

    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        camera_set_view_target(global.camera, global.player_instance);
    } else {
        show_debug_message("WARNING: Player instance not found. Camera setup delayed.");
        alarm[0] = 2; // Retry in 2 frames
    }
}
👉 How to apply?

Find & remove all camera creation calls in obj_camera and obj_initializer.
Instead, call scr_init_camera() in Room Start Event of obj_controller.
Step 2: Improve Skin Switching Code
Issue: The switch_skin() function uses too many hardcoded conditions.
Fix: Use a dictionary-based lookup instead of long if-else chains.
Refactored Skin Switcher (scr_skin_switch.gml)
gml
Copy
Edit
/// scr_skin_switch(new_skin)
/// Switches player skin efficiently using a lookup system.
function scr_skin_switch(new_skin) {
    if (global.skin_switching) return;
    global.skin_switching = true;

    var player_x = 170, player_y = 154, player_face = DOWN;

    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        player_x = global.player_instance.x;
        player_y = global.player_instance.y;
        player_face = global.player_instance.face;
    } else if (variable_global_exists("last_player_x") && variable_global_exists("last_player_y")) {
        player_x = global.last_player_x;
        player_y = global.last_player_y;
    }

    var skin_map = {
        "player": obj_player,
        "icetruck": obj_player_icetruck,
        "tube": obj_player_tube
    };

    var new_skin_object = ds_map_find_value(skin_map, new_skin);
    if (!is_undefined(new_skin_object)) {
        var new_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", new_skin_object);
        new_instance.face = player_face;
        global.player_instance = new_instance;

        with (global.player_instance) {
            image_blend = global.player_color;
        }

        show_debug_message("Switched to skin: " + new_skin);
    } else {
        show_debug_message("ERROR: Invalid skin name " + new_skin);
    }

    global.skin_switching = false;
}
👉 How to apply?

Replace scr_skin_switch.gml with this optimized version.
Call scr_skin_switch("icetruck") instead of using multiple if checks.
Step 3: Optimize Music System
Issue: Unnecessary object references in set_song_ingame().
Fix: Call directly inside obj_musicmanager's Step Event.
New set_song_ingame() Function
gml
Copy
Edit
/// set_song_ingame(song, fadeOutTime, fadeInTime)
/// Smoothly transitions between songs.
function set_song_ingame(song, fadeOutTime = 0, fadeInTime = 0) {
    if (audio_exists(song)) {
        if (audio_is_playing(global.current_song)) {
            audio_stop_sound(global.current_song);
        }

        global.current_song = audio_play_sound(song, 1, true);
        audio_sound_gain(global.current_song, 0, 0);
        audio_sound_gain(global.current_song, 1, fadeInTime);
    }
}
👉 How to apply?

Remove old set_song_ingame() and replace with this version.
Call set_song_ingame(bg_music, 60, 30); in obj_musicmanager.
Step 4: Refactor NPC System
Issue: Repeated dialogue logic across NPCs.
Fix: Create a single function to handle NPC conversations.
Refactored NPC Dialogue System (scr_npc_dialogue.gml)
gml
Copy
Edit
/// scr_npc_dialogue(npc)
/// Advances NPC dialogue and handles quest rewards.
function scr_npc_dialogue(npc) {
    if (npc.current_dialogue_index < array_length(npc.dialogue) - 1) {
        npc.current_dialogue_index++;
    } else {
        npc.current_dialogue_index = -1;

        if (npc.is_quest_giver && !npc.quest_given) {
            npc.quest_given = true;
            if (instance_exists(obj_inventory)) {
                obj_inventory.add_to_inventory(npc.quest_reward);
                show_debug_message(npc.npc_name + " gave you a " + npc.quest_reward + "!");
            }
        }
    }
}
👉 How to apply?

Replace any NPC dialogue handling with scr_npc_dialogue(self);
Remove duplicated if checks inside obj_npc.
Step 5: General Collision Handling Improvements
Issue: scr_handle_collision.gml repeats collision checks multiple times.
Fix: Simplify logic and allow handling multiple object types.
Improved Collision Handling (scr_handle_collision.gml)
gml
Copy
Edit
/// scr_handle_collision(axis, speed, collision_object)
/// Checks collision and adjusts movement speed accordingly.
function scr_handle_collision(axis, speed, collision_object) {
    var offset_x = (axis == "x") ? speed : 0;
    var offset_y = (axis == "y") ? speed : 0;

    if (place_meeting(x + offset_x, y + offset_y, collision_object)) {
        return 0;
    }
    return speed;
}
👉 How to apply?

Replace scr_handle_collision.gml with this version.
When moving an object, call scr_handle_collision("x", x_speed, obj_wall);.
Summary of Changes
System	Issue	Fix
Camera	Multiple redundant camera_create() calls.	Centralized in scr_init_camera().
Player Skins	Overuse of if-else conditions.	Lookup dictionary in scr_skin_switch().
Music	Excessive object references.	Direct song fade-in/out in set_song_ingame().
NPC Dialogue	Repeated logic for quest rewards.	scr_npc_dialogue() to automate quest handling.
Collision Handling	Checks multiple times per axis.	scr_handle_collision() optimizes movement checks.
Final Steps
1. Implement These Changes in Your Project
Copy each new function into your Scripts folder in GameMaker.
Replace existing scripts with their refactored versions.
Ensure all object events now reference these scripts instead of duplicating logic.
2. Test the Game Thoroughly
Ensure the camera follows the player correctly.
Test switching skins (scr_skin_switch("icetruck")).
Interact with NPCs and check if dialogue & quests work as expected.
Verify music fades in/out smoothly (set_song_ingame(bg_music, 60, 30);).
Would you like me to generate an implementation checklist to help with integration? 🚀

📌 Step-by-Step Instructions for Implementation
For each step, replace old scripts and function calls with the optimized versions provided below.

1️⃣ Refactor Player Skin System
Issue: Excessive if-else conditions for switching player skins.
Fix: Use a dictionary-based lookup system instead.
📜 New scr_skin_switch.gml (Optimized)
gml
Copy
Edit
/// scr_skin_switch(new_skin)
/// Switches player skin efficiently using a dictionary lookup.
function scr_skin_switch(new_skin) {
    if (global.skin_switching) return; 
    global.skin_switching = true;

    var player_x = 170, player_y = 154, player_face = DOWN;

    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        player_x = global.player_instance.x;
        player_y = global.player_instance.y;
        player_face = global.player_instance.face;
    } else if (variable_global_exists("last_player_x") && variable_global_exists("last_player_y")) {
        player_x = global.last_player_x;
        player_y = global.last_player_y;
    }

    var skin_map = {
        "player": obj_player,
        "icetruck": obj_player_icetruck,
        "tube": obj_player_tube,
        "sled_player": obj_sled_player,
        "ninja": obj_player_ninja
    };

    var new_skin_object = ds_map_find_value(skin_map, new_skin);
    if (!is_undefined(new_skin_object)) {
        var new_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", new_skin_object);
        new_instance.face = player_face;
        global.player_instance = new_instance;

        with (global.player_instance) {
            image_blend = global.player_color;
        }

        show_debug_message("Switched to skin: " + new_skin);
    } else {
        show_debug_message("ERROR: Invalid skin name " + new_skin);
    }

    global.skin_switching = false;
}
🔧 How to Apply
Replace the old scr_skin_switch.gml with this version.
Update calls to scr_skin_switch() instead of using multiple if conditions.
Example: scr_skin_switch("icetruck"); instead of multiple if-else checks.
2️⃣ Streamline Camera Creation
Issue: Multiple camera_create() calls, leading to unnecessary memory usage.
Fix: Ensure only one camera instance is created and properly follows the player.
📜 New scr_init_camera.gml
gml
Copy
Edit
/// scr_init_camera()
/// Ensures a single instance of the camera exists & follows the player.
function scr_init_camera() {
    if (!variable_global_exists("camera") || !is_real(global.camera)) {
        global.camera = camera_create();
        camera_set_view_size(global.camera, view_wview[0], view_hview[0]);
        view_camera[0] = global.camera;
        show_debug_message("New global camera created.");
    }

    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        camera_set_view_target(global.camera, global.player_instance);
    } else {
        show_debug_message("WARNING: Player instance not found. Camera setup delayed.");
        alarm[0] = 2; // Retry in 2 frames
    }
}
🔧 How to Apply
Replace all camera_create() calls with scr_init_camera();
Call scr_init_camera() inside the Room Start event of obj_controller.
3️⃣ Improve NPC Dialogue System
Issue: Repeated logic for NPC conversations and quest handling.
Fix: Centralize NPC dialogue into a single reusable function.
📜 New scr_npc_dialogue.gml
gml
Copy
Edit
/// scr_npc_dialogue(npc)
/// Advances NPC dialogue and handles quest rewards.
function scr_npc_dialogue(npc) {
    if (npc.current_dialogue_index < array_length(npc.dialogue) - 1) {
        npc.current_dialogue_index++;
    } else {
        npc.current_dialogue_index = -1;

        if (npc.is_quest_giver && !npc.quest_given) {
            npc.quest_given = true;
            if (instance_exists(obj_inventory)) {
                obj_inventory.add_to_inventory(npc.quest_reward);
                show_debug_message(npc.npc_name + " gave you a " + npc.quest_reward + "!");
            }
        }
    }
}
🔧 How to Apply
Replace obj_npc’s dialogue code with a call to scr_npc_dialogue(self);.
This automates dialogue progression and quest item giving.
4️⃣ Optimize Obstacle Spawning
Issue: Obstacles spawn at fixed intervals, making gameplay predictable.
Fix: Adjust spawn rate dynamically based on game conditions.
📜 New scr_obstacle_spawn.gml
gml
Copy
Edit
/// scr_obstacle_spawn()
/// Spawns obstacles dynamically with a variable spawn rate.
function scr_obstacle_spawn() {
    var spawn_interval = max(15, 60 - (global.game_timer / 10)); // Faster spawn over time
    instance_create_layer(random(room_width), room_height, "Instances", obj_obstacle);
    alarm[0] = spawn_interval;
}
🔧 How to Apply
Replace Alarm[0] event in obj_obstacle_controller with scr_obstacle_spawn();.
Adjusts spawn rate dynamically based on time (global.game_timer).
5️⃣ Implement a UI Manager
Issue: UI elements (pause menu, settings menu) are managed separately.
Fix: Centralize UI control into a single UI Manager object (obj_ui_manager).
📜 New scr_ui_manager.gml
gml
Copy
Edit
/// scr_ui_manager(action)
/// Manages UI elements like pause menu, settings, etc.
function scr_ui_manager(action) {
    switch (action) {
        case "pause":
            global.is_pause_menu_active = !global.is_pause_menu_active;
            if (global.is_pause_menu_active) {
                instance_create_layer(0, 0, "UI", obj_pause_menu);
            } else {
                with (obj_pause_menu) instance_destroy();
            }
            break;

        case "settings":
            instance_create_layer(0, 0, "UI", obj_main_settings);
            break;

        case "close_settings":
            with (obj_main_settings) instance_destroy();
            break;
    }
}
🔧 How to Apply
Create a new object obj_ui_manager.
Call scr_ui_manager("pause") instead of manually handling pause menus.
Use scr_ui_manager("settings") to open settings.
