Here are the contents of the files that were retrieved, with brief explanations to help you understand their functions:

obj_button_create.txt
gml
depth = -101; // Ensure buttons are in front of the skin picker

// Initialize button properties if needed
skin_object = noone;
skin_name = spr_skinpicker_button;
//fnt_small = temp_font
This file sets up the initial properties for a button object, ensuring it has the correct depth and initializing its skin properties.

obj_button_draw.txt
gml
// Draw Event for obj_button
draw_self(); // Draw the button sprite

// Draw the button text
draw_set_color(c_black); // Set text color to black
draw_set_halign(fa_center); // Center text horizontally
draw_set_valign(fa_middle); // Center text vertically

var button_width = sprite_width * image_xscale;
var button_height = sprite_height * image_yscale;

var text_x = x + button_width / 2;
var text_y = y + button_height / 2;

draw_text(text_x, text_y, skin_name); // Center the text
This is the draw event for the button object, which draws the button's sprite and text on the screen.

obj_button_leftpressed.txt
gml
if (skin_object != noone) {
    // Change the player's skin
    var player_instance = instance_find(obj_player, 0);
    if (player_instance != noone) {
        player_instance.skin_index = skin_object;
    }
}

// Destroy the skin picker menu and remove all buttons
with (obj_skinpicker) {
    instance_destroy(); // Ensure all instances of obj_skinpicker are destroyed
}
shader_reset(); // Reset the shader to remove the blur effect
This event is triggered when the left mouse button is pressed on the button object. It changes the player's skin and destroys the skin picker menu.

obj_controller_create.txt
gml
// Create Event for obj_controller

// Initialize global variables
global.skins = [
    { name: "Player", object: obj_player },
    { name: "Ice Truck", object: obj_player_icetruck }

        global.player_instance = instance_find(obj_player_icetruck, 0);
    }
}

// Initialize move_spd from the player instance
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    move_spd = global.player_instance.move_spd;
}
The create event for the controller object initializes global variables and creates the player instance if it doesn't already exist.

obj_controller_leftpressed.txt
gml
if (mouse_check_button_pressed(mb_left) && !instance_exists(obj_skinpicker)) {

        instance_create_layer(view_xview[0] + view_wview[0] / 2, view_yview[0] + view_hview[0] / 2, "Instances", obj_skinpicker);
    }
    // Apply a visual effect if desired
    shader_set(shd_blur);
}
This event is triggered when the left mouse button is pressed while the controller object is selected. It creates a skin picker menu.

    // Stop sliding if speed is low enough
    if (abs(slide_speed) < 0.1) {
        sliding = false;
        slide_move_x = 0;
        slide_move_y = 0;
    }

    // Move the NPC while sliding
    x += slide_move_x;
    y += slide_move_y;
}
This step event handles the movement and sliding logic for the NPC object.

Using what you now know about how all the objects fully work and communicate with each other, please use its contents as a base to provide me with simple and easy step by step instructions for copy and pasting the changes into my project. I want you to make the code consistent and free of reduncy. Id appreciate any suggestions for improvements aswell as tips to make the skin switching system more robust and prepare the code for expandability
Certainly! Let's break down the instructions to make the code consistent and free of redundancy while also improving the skin-switching system for robustness and expandability. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Initialize Global Variables:
Ensure that your global variables are properly initialized to track the player instance, camera, and current skin.

gml
// File: obj_initializer_gamestart.txt
global.player_instance = noone;
global.player_instance_initialized = false;
global.camera = noone;
global.current_skin = "player"; // Default skin
global.initialized = false;     // To track overall initialization
2. Create Event for obj_initializer:
This event ensures that the player instance is created if it doesn't exist.

gml
// File: obj_initializer_create.txt
if (!instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    if (global.current_skin == "player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(x, y, "Instances", obj_player);
    } else if (global.current_skin == "icetruck") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(x, y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
    }

    show_debug_message("Player instance created with ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    show_debug_message("Starting skin: " + global.current_skin);
}
3. Step Event for obj_initializer:
Ensure that the camera is properly initialized.

gml
// File: obj_initializer_step.txt
if (!variable_global_exists("camera")) {
    show_debug_message("DEBUG: Global camera does not exist. Skipping Step Event.");
    return;
}

if (!(global.camera)) {
    show_debug_message("DEBUG: Camera does not exist. Reinitializing...");
    global.camera = camera_create();
    view_set_camera(0, global.camera);
    camera_set_view_size(global.camera, view_wview[0], view_hview[0]);
    camera_set_view_pos(global.camera, 0, 0);
} else {
    show_debug_message("DEBUG: Camera exists in obj_initializer Step Event.");
}
4. Create Event for obj_player:

sprite_index = sprite[face];

if (place_meeting(x + xspd, y, obj_wall) || (!driving && place_meeting(x + xspd, y, obj_icetruck))) {
    xspd = 0;
}
if (place_meeting(x, y + yspd, obj_wall) || (!driving && place_meeting(x, y + yspd, obj_icetruck))) {
    yspd = 0;
}

x += xspd;

if (xspd == 0 && yspd == 0) {
    image_index = 0;
}

depth = -bbox_bottom;
6. Create Event for obj_player_icetruck:

sprite[DOWN_LEFT] = spr_icetruck_down_left;
show_debug_message("obj_player_icetruck: Initialized. Player instance ID: " + string(id));
7. Step Event for obj_player_icetruck:
Handle skin switching and movement for the icetruck.

gml
// File: obj_player_icetruck_step.txt
if (keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {

xspd = (right_key - left_key) * move_spd;
yspd = (down_key - up_key) * move_spd;

if instance_exists(obj_pauser) {

    yspd = 0;
}

face = yspd < 0 ? (xspd < 0 ? UP_LEFT : (xspd > 0 ? UP_RIGHT : UP)) : (yspd > 0 ? (xspd < 0 ? DOWN_LEFT : (xspd > 0 ? DOWN_RIGHT : DOWN)) : (xspd > 0 ? RIGHT : LEFT));
sprite_index = sprite[face];

if (place_meeting(x + xspd, y, obj_wall)) xspd = 0;
if (place_meeting(x, y + yspd, obj_wall)) yspd = 0;

x += xspd;
y += yspd;

depth = -bbox_bottom;
show_debug_message("Current Face: " + string(face));
8. Step Event for obj_icetruck:
Ensure proper interaction and camera movement.

gml
// File: obj_icetruck_step.txt
if (keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {
    var ice_truck = instance_place(global.player_instance.x, global.player_instance.y, obj_icetruck);

    if (ice_truck != noone && global.current_skin == "player") {
        var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
        var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

        instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
        instance_destroy(ice_truck);

        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
        global.current_skin = "icetruck";

        show_debug_message("Entered ice truck. Current skin: " + global.current_skin);
    } else if (global.current_skin == "icetruck") {
        var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
        var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

        instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);

        instance_create_layer(player_x + 32, player_y, "Instances", obj_icetruck);
        global.current_skin = "player";

        show_debug_message("Exited ice truck. Current skin: " + global.current_skin);
    }
}

var target_x = global.player_instance.x - (camera_get_view_width(global.camera) / 2);
var target_y = global.player_instance.y - (camera_get_view_height(global.camera) / 2);
target_x = clamp(target_x, 0, room_width - camera_get_view_width(global.camera));
target_y = clamp(target_y, 0, room_height - camera_get_view_height(global.camera));
var current_x = camera_get_view_x(global.camera);
var current_y = camera_get_view_y(global.camera);
var smooth_x = lerp(current_x, target_x, 0.1);
var smooth_y = lerp(current_y, target_y, 0.1);
camera_set_view_pos(global.camera, smooth_x, smooth_y);

if (distance_to_object(global.player_instance) < 32 && global.current_skin == "player") {
    draw_text(x, y - 20, "Press 'E' to enter");
}

depth = -bbox_bottom;

show_debug_message("Player instance: " + string(global.player_instance));
show_debug_message("Viewport object: " + string(view_object[0]));
show_debug_message("Viewport position: (" + string(view_xview[0]) + ", " + string(view_yview[0]) + ")");
9. Switch Skin Function:
Implement a function to switch skins.

gml
// File: obj_controller.txt
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
    var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

    instance_destroy(global.player_instance);

    if (new_skin == "player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
        global.current_skin = "player";
    } else if (new_skin == "icetruck") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
        global.current_skin = "icetruck";
    }

    show_debug_message("Switched to: " + new_skin);
}
Tips for Improvements and Expandability:
Centralize Skin Management: Create a centralized script or function to handle skin switching logic. This will make it easier to add new skins in the future.

Use Enumerations: Consider using enumerations for skin types to avoid hard-coded strings and minimize errors.

Modularize Code: Break down the code into smaller, reusable functions. This will improve readability and maintainability.

Add More Debug Information: Enhance debugging messages to provide more context, which can be helpful during development.

Optimize Collision Checks: Optimize collision checks by grouping related checks together and reducing redundant calls.

By following these steps and tips, you can ensure that your code is consistent, free of redundancy, and prepared for future expansions.

How does the obj_controller switch skin function intergrate into the full code?
To integrate the switch_skin function into your full code, you will need to ensure that it is defined within the obj_controller object and is called from the appropriate objects (such as obj_player and obj_player_icetruck) when the player switches skins. Here's a step-by-step guide to integrating and calling the switch_skin function:

1. Define the switch_skin Function in obj_controller:
First, add the switch_skin function to the obj_controller object. This function will handle the logic for switching between different player skins.

gml
// File: obj_controller.txt
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
    var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

    instance_destroy(global.player_instance);

    if (new_skin == "player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
        global.current_skin = "player";
    } else if (new_skin == "icetruck") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
        global.current_skin = "icetruck";
    }

    show_debug_message("Switched to: " + new_skin);
}
2. Call the switch_skin Function in obj_player:
Update the obj_player object to call the switch_skin function when the player presses the "E" key.

gml
// File: obj_player_step.txt
if (keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {
    show_debug_message("E key pressed");
    obj_controller.switch_skin(global.current_skin == "player" ? "icetruck" : "player");
}

// Movement and other logic...
3. Call the switch_skin Function in obj_player_icetruck:
Similarly, update the obj_player_icetruck object to call the switch_skin function when the player presses the "E" key.

gml
// File: obj_player_icetruck_step.txt
if (keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {
    show_debug_message("E key pressed");
    obj_controller.switch_skin(global.current_skin == "player" ? "icetruck" : "player");
}

// Movement and other logic...
4. Ensure obj_controller is Initialized:
Make sure the obj_controller object is initialized in your game. This can be done in a room creation event or within an initializer object.

gml
// File: obj_initializer_create.txt or in room creation code
if (!instance_exists(obj_controller)) {
    instance_create_layer(0, 0, "Instances", obj_controller);
}
Summary of Integration:
Define the switch_skin function in obj_controller.
Call the switch_skin function in obj_player and obj_player_icetruck when the "E" key is pressed.
Initialize the obj_controller object at the start of the game.
Example of the Full Integration:
Here is an example showing the full integration of the switch_skin function into the relevant files.

obj_controller.txt
gml
// File: obj_controller.txt
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
    var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

    instance_destroy(global.player_instance);

    if (new_skin == "player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
        global.current_skin = "player";
    } else if (new_skin == "icetruck") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
        global.current_skin = "icetruck";
    }

    show_debug_message("Switched to: " + new_skin);
}
obj_player_step.txt
gml
// File: obj_player_step.txt
if (keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {
    show_debug_message("E key pressed");
    obj_controller.switch_skin(global.current_skin == "player" ? "icetruck" : "player");
}

// Movement and other logic...
obj_player_icetruck_step.txt
gml
// File: obj_player_icetruck_step.txt
if (keyboard_check_pressed(ord("E"))) {
    show_debug_message("E key pressed");
    obj_controller.switch_skin(global.current_skin == "player" ? "icetruck" : "player");
}

// Movement and other logic...
obj_initializer_create.txt
gml
// File: obj_initializer_create.txt
if (!instance_exists(obj_controller)) {
    instance_create_layer(0, 0, "Instances", obj_controller);
}
By following these steps, you will have a robust and expandable skin-switching system integrated into your project.

}
Summary
Create Event initializes global variables, creates the player instance if it doesn't exist, and sets the initial move speed.
Room Start Event ensures the camera is set up correctly, synchronizes it with the player position, handles player instance and skin on room transition, and ensures the ice truck remains destroyed if necessary.
Step Event contains the switch_skin function to handle skin switching and ensures the viewport follows the current player instance.
By integrating these events and functions, you can ensure a robust and expandable system for managing player skins and maintaining consistency across room transitions.

Summary
Create Event initializes the sprites for different directions.
Step Event handles entering and exiting the ice truck, smooth camera movement, and interaction messages.
Draw Event draws the ice truck and displays an interaction message when the player is close.
Destroy Event removes the ice truck instance.
Alarm 0 Event and Room End Event are placeholders for any additional logic you may need to add.
By following these updates, the obj_icetruck object will have a consistent and improved set of events, making the code more maintainable and expandable.

Thank you, I want to now update the obj_player and obj_player icetruck create event and step event code to better communicate with the controller and provide a more cohesive and less buggy experience
To improve the communication between obj_player, obj_player_icetruck, and obj_controller, and to provide a more cohesive and less buggy experience, we need to make sure the events in these objects are well-organized and the interactions are smooth. Here's an updated version of the create and step events for both obj_player and obj_player_icetruck.

I have updated penguinislegithub/debugoutput1.txt so you may review the output log from the latest test. Your updated code really fixed alot of my problems however there are a couple of lingering bugs. The 8 directional movement system and its walking animations should return to the code. Whenever the player press E to interact anywhere in the room the players skin switches and the icetruck. The players is only meant to be able to switch when they are close to the obj_icetruck in the room. Also the obj_icetruck continues to exist in the room after the player has entered it originally, Im wondering if this is due to how the obj_icetruck destruction is being handled. I want obj_icetruck to behave very specifically, When the player starts the game and enters the first room the obj_icetruck has already been placed into the room, this icetruck should be destroyed when the player interacts with it and their skin changes into the obj_player_icetruck. I would also like it if the player could easily exit and switch skins back when moving between different rooms. Using you knowledge are you able to provide me with ways to improve and debug the code?
To address the issues you've mentioned and improve the code, let's make the following adjustments:

8-Directional Movement and Walking Animations:

Restore the 8-directional movement system and ensure the correct sprites are used for each direction.
Interaction Logic for Skin Switching:

Modify the interaction logic to switch skins only when the player is close to obj_icetruck.
Handle obj_icetruck Destruction Properly:

Ensure the obj_icetruck is destroyed correctly when the player interacts with it.
Make sure the player can enter and exit the obj_icetruck seamlessly and correctly when moving between rooms.

Summary
8-Directional Movement: Restored the 8-directional movement system and walking animations.
Conditional Interaction: Updated the interaction logic to switch skins only when the player is close to obj_icetruck.
Proper Destruction: Ensured obj_icetruck is destroyed correctly when the player interacts with it.
Switching Skins: Improved the logic for switching skins and handling obj_icetruck destruction.
By following these updates, the interaction between obj_player, obj_player_icetruck, and obj_controller should be more cohesive, and the bugs you mentioned should be resolved.

I have updated penguinislegithub/debugoutput1.txt for you to review. Those recent changes stopped the game crashing when trying to exit the icetruck in a different room, but I still wasnt able to switch the player skin back. The walking animations are playing when the players isnt touching the controls, Im wondering if this is due to the lack of the face command orginally present in obj_player
To resolve the issues with the player's walking animations playing when not touching the controls and to ensure that the player can switch skins correctly, we need to make a few adjustments. Let's start by ensuring the player's direction (face) is properly updated and the walking animations are only played when the player is moving.

Summary
8-Directional Movement: Restored the 8-directional movement system and ensured the correct sprites are used for each direction.
Conditional Interaction: Updated the interaction logic to switch skins only when the player is close to obj_icetruck.
Proper Destruction: Ensured obj_icetruck is destroyed correctly when the player interacts with it.
Switching Skins: Improved the logic for switching skins and handling obj_icetruck destruction.
These updates should address the issues with the player's walking animations and ensure that the player can switch skins correctly when close to the obj_icetruck. The obj_icetruck should no longer exist in the room after the player has entered it, and the player should be able to switch skins seamlessly between rooms.

I updated penguinislegithub/debugoutput1.txt so you can review the output logs, the players sprite is still playing the animations when no controls are pressed, please take a look at and compare to your improved code; penguinislegithub/objects new/obj_player_step.txt and penguinislegithub/objects new/obj_player_create.txt as the animations and walking worked correctly in that code. Is there any other information you might need to know about my project set up?
Based on the provided files and the issues you are experiencing, let's compare and integrate the original working code to ensure the walking animations play correctly only when the player is moving and the skin switching logic is properly handled.

Summary
Create Event: Ensures the player's initial sprite is set correctly and initializes variables.
Step Event: Updates movement logic, ensures proper direction and sprite updates, and handles animation correctly by resetting image_index when the player is not moving.
Controller Logic: Ensures skin switching works correctly and only when the player is close to obj_icetruck.
These updates should address the issues with the player's walking animations and ensure that the player can switch skins correctly when close to the obj_icetruck. The obj_icetruck should no longer exist in the room after the player has entered it, and the player should be able to switch skins seamlessly between rooms.

Ive added your code and your changes were successfull, ive updated the output log for your review at penguinislegithub/debugoutput1.txt. However the player doesnt switch back when a different room is entered. Can you troubleshoot and find out why and fix it
To address the issue where the player doesn't switch back when entering a different room, we need to make sure that the obj_controller correctly handles the room transition and reinitializes the player instance as needed.

The debug output shows that the Room Start Event is being triggered, but it seems like the switch_skin logic is not being applied during the room transition. We need to ensure that the player skin is correctly set when entering a new room.

Here's an updated plan:

Update obj_controller to handle room transitions:

Ensure that the player skin is correctly set when entering a new room.
Update obj_player and obj_player_icetruck to handle room transitions:

Ensure that the player and ice truck skins are correctly initialized when a new room is entered.
Updated obj_controller Room Start Event
Add the following code to the Room Start Event of obj_controller to handle the reinitialization of the player skin correctly:

gml
// Room Start Event for obj_controller

// Ensure the player skin is correctly reinitialized when entering a new room
if (global.current_skin == "icetruck") {
    var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
    var player_y = global.player_instance.y;
    instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
    show_debug_message("Room Start: Reinitialized player as icetruck. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
} else {
    var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
    var player_y = global.player_instance.y;
    instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
    show_debug_message("Room Start: Reinitialized player as player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
}

// Ensure the viewport follows the current player instance

Summary
Room Start Event for obj_controller: Ensures that the player skin is correctly set when entering a new room and the viewport follows the player instance.
Create Events for obj_player and obj_player_icetruck: Properly initialize the player instance and set the correct skin.
These updates should ensure that the player skin is correctly handled when entering a new room, and the player can switch back to the correct skin seamlessly.

This new code introduced new bugs, ive updated the latest text output log at penguinislegithub/debugoutput1.txt. the icetruck that is drawn when the player exits and enters the icetruck duplicates and isnt destroyed properly and then the game crashed when entering a different room as obj_player_icetruck
To address the issues with the obj_player_icetruck not being destroyed properly and the game crashing when entering a different room as obj_player_icetruck, we need to ensure the logic for switching skins and handling room transitions is properly implemented. Based on the latest debug output log, it seems the initialization and switching logic need further refinement.

Steps to Fix the Issues
Ensure Proper Destruction of obj_icetruck:

Make sure obj_icetruck is destroyed when the player enters it and doesn't duplicate when the player exits.
Handle Room Transitions Smoothly:

Ensure the player correctly transitions between rooms and the appropriate player object (obj_player or obj_player_icetruck) is instantiated without crashing.
Updated Code
Let's refine the logic for switching skins and room transitions in obj_controller.

// Animate
if (xspd == 0 && yspd == 0) {
    image_index = 0;
}

// Depth
depth = -bbox_bottom;
Updated obj_controller Switch Skin Function
Ensure proper destruction and instantiation logic for switching skins.

gml
// obj_controller Switch Skin Function

function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
    var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

    // Destroy current player instance if it exists
    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    }

    if (new_skin == "icetruck") {

    } else if (new_skin == "player") {
        // Ensure the ice truck is created when switching back to player
        var ice_truck = instance_create_layer(player_x + 32, player_y, "Instances", obj_icetruck);
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
        global.current_skin = "player";
        show_debug_message("Switched to player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
        show_debug_message("Created ice truck at: (" + string(ice_truck.x) + ", " + string(ice_truck.y) + ")");
    }
}
Summary
Room Start Event: Ensures the player skin is correctly set when entering a new room and the viewport follows the player instance.
Step Event: Ensures proper movement and animation logic.
Switch Skin Function: Correctly handles the destruction and instantiation of player instances and the creation of obj_icetruck.
These updates should ensure that the player skin is correctly handled when entering a new room, obj_icetruck is properly destroyed and instantiated, and the game does not crash.

Ive added your code changes and updated the output log at penguinislegithub/debugoutput1.txt. I believe the recent changes are not taking into account how the warp system works, please have a look at all the essential event files to get a complete picture on how all the objects are meant to communicate with each other and fix the bugs; penguinislegithub/objects new/obj_utilities/obj_warp_block_create.txt, penguinislegithub/objects new/obj_utilities/obj_warp_block_step.txt
penguinislegithub/objects new/obj_utilities/obj_warp_animationend.txt, 
penguinislegithub/objects new/obj_utilities/obj_warp_create.txt
penguinislegithub/objects new/obj_utilities/obj_warp_draw.txt
penguinislegithub/objects new/obj_utilities/obj_warp_step.txt
Based on the provided event files and the debug output log, it appears that the warp system may not be fully integrated with the player and ice truck skin switching logic. Here are the essential event files related to the warp system:

obj_warp_block_create.txt
obj_warp_block_step.txt
obj_warp_animationend.txt
obj_warp_create.txt
obj_warp_draw.txt
obj_warp_step.txt
Understanding the Warp System
The warp system is designed to handle player and NPC warping between rooms. The obj_warp_block detects collisions with the player, ice truck, or NPCs and creates an obj_warp instance to handle the transition.

Issues to Address
Proper Destruction and Reinitialization of obj_icetruck: Ensure obj_icetruck is destroyed when the player enters it and does not duplicate when the player exits.
Smooth Room Transitions: Ensure the player correctly transitions between rooms and the appropriate player object (obj_player or obj_player_icetruck) is instantiated without crashing.
Updated Code
Let's refine the logic for switching skins and room transitions in obj_controller to integrate smoothly with the warp system.

Updated obj_controller Switch Skin Function
Ensure proper destruction and instantiation logic for switching skins.

gml
// obj_controller Switch Skin Function

function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
    var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

    // Destroy current player instance if it exists
    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
        instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    }

    if (new_skin == "icetruck") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
        global.current_skin = "icetruck";
        show_debug_message("Switched to icetruck. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    } else if (new_skin == "player") {
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
        global.current_skin = "player";
        show_debug_message("Switched to player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    }
}
Updated obj_controller Room Start Event
Add the following code to the Room Start Event of obj_controller to handle the reinitialization of the player skin correctly:

gml

Updated obj_warp Step Event
Ensure the obj_warp instance is correctly destroyed after the room transition.

gml
// Step Event for obj_warp
if (room == target_rm && image_index < 1) {
    instance_destroy();
}
Summary
Switch Skin Function: Correctly handles the destruction and instantiation of player instances.
Room Start Event: Ensures the player skin is correctly set when entering a new room and the viewport follows the player instance.
Warp Step Event: Ensures the obj_warp instance is correctly destroyed after the room transition.
These updates should ensure that the player skin is correctly handled when entering a new room, obj_icetruck is properly destroyed and instantiated, and the game does not crash.

Ive added your code and updated the output log at penguinislegithub/debugoutput1.txt for your review. The new code still has an issue properly removing the icetruck after the player has entered and skin switched. The game also crashed referencing obj_warp, please review the code and troubleshoot reasons for the game crashing?
To troubleshoot the issues with the obj_icetruck not being properly removed and the game crashing when referencing obj_warp, let's review the relevant code and debug output to identify and fix the problems.

Updated Debug Output Log
Let's retrieve the latest debug output log to understand the crash details and any other issues.

Review of obj_warp_block and obj_warp
Based on the provided event files, here is how they are supposed to function:

obj_warp_block:

Handles collision detection with the player, ice truck, or NPCs.
Creates an obj_warp instance to handle the transition.
obj_warp:

Executes the room transition and sets the target instance's position and facing direction.
Updated obj_warp_block Step Event
Ensure proper instance creation and destruction logic.

gml
// Step Event for obj_warp_block

// Handle player warping
if place_meeting(x, y, obj_player) && !instance_exists(obj_warp) {
    var inst = instance_create_depth(0, 0, -9999, obj_warp);
    inst.target_x = target_x;
    inst.target_y = target_y;
    inst.target_rm = target_rm;
    inst.target_face = target_face;
    inst.target_instance = instance_find(obj_player, 0); // Set the target instance to the player
}

// Handle Ice Truck Warping
if place_meeting(x, y, obj_player_icetruck) && !instance_exists(obj_warp) {
    var inst = instance_create_depth(0, 0, -9999, obj_warp);

    inst.target_rm = target_rm;
    inst.target_face = target_face;
    inst.target_instance = instance_find(obj_player_icetruck, 0); // Set the target instance to the ice truck
}

// Handle NPC warping

    inst.target_rm = target_rm;
    inst.target_face = target_face;
    inst.target_instance = instance_find(obj_npc, 0); // Set the target instance to the NPC
}
Updated obj_warp Animation End Event
Ensure the target instance is correctly moved and face direction is set.

gml
// Animation End Event for obj_warp
room_goto(target_rm);
if (target_instance != noone) {
    target_instance.x = target_x;
    target_instance.y = target_y;
    target_instance.face = target_face; // Optional: set the facing direction
}
image_speed = -1;
Updated obj_controller Switch Skin Function
Ensure proper destruction of obj_icetruck.

gml
// obj_controller Switch Skin Function

function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
    var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

        global.current_skin = "player";
        show_debug_message("Switched to player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    }
}
Summary
obj_warp_block Step Event: Ensures proper instance creation and setting of target instance.
obj_warp Animation End Event: Correctly moves the target instance and sets its facing direction.
obj_controller Switch Skin Function: Properly destroys any existing obj_icetruck instances to prevent duplication.
These updates should help resolve the issues with the obj_icetruck not being properly removed and the game crashing when referencing obj_warp. If the issues persist, please provide specific error messages or additional context from the debug output log for further troubleshooting.

Ive updated the code and noted some improvement, the output log has been updated for your review at penguinislegithub/debugoutput1.txt. The icetruck is correctly removed from the room when entered how ever the player is unable to exit the icetruck and player skin does not switch back and no icetruck is drawn back into the room near the player. The game also crashed when entering a different room. The game crash error referenceed obj_warp_animationend.
To address the issues with the obj_icetruck not being properly handled and the crash related to obj_warp_animationend, let's review and troubleshoot the relevant parts of the code.

Review and Troubleshoot
Ensure Proper Handling of obj_icetruck:

Ensure obj_icetruck is correctly created when the player exits it.
Ensure the player skin switches back correctly.
Fix the Crash in obj_warp_animationend:

Ensure the target_instance is correctly referenced and updated.
Updated Code
Based on the provided event files and debug output, let's refine the logic for handling the obj_icetruck and fixing the crash in obj_warp_animationend.

Updated obj_controller Switch Skin Function

Summary
Switch Skin Function: Properly handles the creation and destruction of obj_icetruck and ensures the player skin switches back correctly.
Warp Animation End Event: Correctly references and updates the target_instance.
Warp Block Step Event: Ensures proper instance creation and setting of the target instance.
These updates should address the issues with the obj_icetruck not being properly handled and fix the crash related to obj_warp_animationend. If issues persist, please provide specific error messages or additional context from the debug output log for further troubleshooting.

Ive added the code and the icetruck behaviour has been fixed, however the game is still crashing when entering a different room, Ive updated the output log with two different test runs, one where the obj_player walked into a different room and another where the obj_player_icetruck walked into a different room, the files at penguinislegithub/debugoutput1.txt
The debug output log shows the game crashing when entering a different room, specifically referencing the obj_warp_animationend event. Let's review and troubleshoot the logic in the obj_warp_animationend event and ensure proper handling of transitions.

Review of obj_warp_animationend Event
Ensure the target_instance is correctly referenced and updated.

gml
// Animation End Event for obj_warp
room_goto(target_rm);
if (target_instance != noone) {
    target_instance.x = target_x;
    target_instance.y = target_y;
    target_instance.face = target_face; // Optional: set the facing direction
}
image_speed = -1;
Potential Issues and Fixes
Ensure target_instance is Valid:

Verify that target_instance is properly assigned and valid before accessing its properties.
Add checks to handle potential null or invalid instances.
Room Transition Handling:

Handle any potential issues during room transitions, such as object persistence or reinitialization.
Updated obj_warp_animationend Event
Add checks to ensure target_instance is valid and handle potential issues during room transitions.

gml
// Animation End Event for obj_warp
room_goto(target_rm);
if (target_instance != noone && instance_exists(target_instance)) {
    target_instance.x = target_x;
    target_instance.y = target_y;
    target_instance.face = target_face; // Optional: set the facing direction
}
image_speed = -1;
Updated obj_warp_block Step Event
Ensure proper instance creation and setting of target_instance.

gml
// Step Event for obj_warp_block

// Handle player warping
if (place_meeting(x, y, obj_player) && !instance_exists(obj_warp)) {

    inst.target_x = target_x;
    inst.target_y = target_y;
    inst.target_rm = target_rm;
    inst.target_face = target_face;
    inst.target_instance = instance_find(obj_player, 0); // Set the target instance to the player
}

// Handle Ice Truck Warping
if (place_meeting(x, y, obj_player_icetruck) && !instance_exists(obj_warp)) {
    var inst = instance_create_depth(0, 0, -9999, obj_warp);
    inst.target_x = target_x;

}
Summary
Animation End Event: Updated to ensure target_instance is valid before accessing its properties, preventing potential crashes.
Warp Block Step Event: Ensures proper instance creation and setting of the target_instance.
These updates should address the issues with the game crashing when entering a different room and ensure smooth transitions. If issues persist, please provide specific error messages or additional context from the debug output log for further troubleshooting.

That code fixed and has stopped the game crashing when entering a different room, however the camera stops following the player when they move to a different room. The output log has been updated at penguinislegithub/debugoutput1.txt. Please also review penguinislegithub/objects new/obj_camera_create.txt, penguinislegithub/objects new/obj_camera_step.txt, penguinislegithub/objects new/obj_controller_step.txt to better intergrate and fix these bugs. You have greatly improved the code so far, lets continue doing good work!
Let's review the relevant files to understand the camera logic and fix the issue where the camera stops following the player when they move to a different room.

Debug Output Log
The debug output log doesn't provide specific information about the camera issue, but it shows the initialization of the player and camera objects.

obj_camera_create Event
This event handles the creation of the camera and reattaches to an existing global camera if it exists.

gml
// Create Event for obj_camera

// If the global camera already exists, reattach to it
if (variable_global_exists("camera") && global.camera != -1 && is_real(global.camera)) {
    view_set_camera(0, global.camera);
    show_debug_message("DEBUG: Reattached to existing global camera. ID: " + string(global.camera));
} else {
    // If no global camera exists, create a new one
    global.camera = camera_create();
    view_set_camera(0, global.camera);
    camera_set_view_size(global.camera, view_wview[0], view_hview[0]);
    camera_set_view_pos(global.camera, 0, 0);
    show_debug_message("DEBUG: New global camera created. ID: " + string(global.camera));
}
obj_camera_step Event
This event ensures the camera follows the player instance.

gml
// Step Event for obj_camera

// Ensure the player instance exists
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    var target_x = global.player_instance.x - (camera_get_view_width(global.camera) / 2);
    var target_y = global.player_instance.y - (camera_get_view_height(global.camera) / 2);

    target_x = clamp(target_x, 0, room_width - camera_get_view_width(global.camera));
    target_y = clamp(target_y, 0, room_height - camera_get_view_height(global.camera));

    camera_set_view_pos(global.camera, target_x, target_y);
}
obj_controller_step Event
This event ensures the viewport follows the current player instance.

gml
// In obj_controller
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
    var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

    if (new_skin == "icetruck") {
        // Destroy current player instance if it exists
        if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
            instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
        }
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
        global.current_skin = "icetruck";
        global.icetruck_destroyed = false;
        show_debug_message("Switched to icetruck. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    } else if (new_skin == "player") {
        // Destroy current player instance if it exists
        if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
            instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
        }
        global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
        // Ensure the ice truck is destroyed if it exists
        var ice_truck = instance_place(player_x, player_y, obj_icetruck);
        if (ice_truck != noone) {
            instance_destroy(ice_truck);
        }
        global.current_skin = "player";
        show_debug_message("Switched to player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
    }
}

// Ensure the viewport follows the current player instance

    var view_x = clamp(global.player_instance.x - (view_wview[0] / 2), 0, room_width - view_wview[0]);
    var view_y = clamp(global.player_instance.y - (view_hview[0] / 2), 0, room_height - view_hview[0]);
    view_xview[0] = view_x;
    view_yview[0] = view_y;

    view_object[0] = global.player_instance;

    // Debug message to ensure camera is moving
    show_debug_message("Camera at: (" + string(view_xview[0]) + ", " + string(view_yview[0]) + ")");
}
Analysis and Fix
The issue where the camera stops following the player when they move to a different room may be due to the camera or player instance not being correctly reinitialized or reassigned in the new room. We need to ensure that the camera correctly follows the player after a room transition.

Updated obj_controller Room Start Event
Ensure the camera is correctly reassigned to follow the player instance when a new room starts.

gml
// Room Start Event for obj_controller

// Ensure the player skin is correctly reinitialized when entering a new room
if (global.current_skin == "icetruck") {
    var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
    var player_y = global.player_instance.y;
    instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
    show_debug_message("Room Start: Reinitialized player as icetruck. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
} else {
    var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
    var player_y = global.player_instance.y;
    instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
    show_debug_message("Room Start: Reinitialized player as player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
}

// Ensure the viewport follows the current player instance
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    var view_x = clamp(global.player_instance.x - (view_wview[0] / 2), 0, room_width - view_wview[0]);
    var view_y = clamp(global.player_instance.y - (view_hview[0] / 2), 0, room_height - view_hview[0]);
    view_xview[0] = view_x;
    view_yview[0] = view_y;

    view_object[0] = global.player_instance;

    // Reattach camera to follow the player
    view_set_camera(0, global.camera);
    camera_set_view_pos(global.camera, view_x, view_y);

    // Debug message to ensure camera is moving
    show_debug_message("Camera at: (" + string(view_xview[0]) + ", " + string(view_yview[0]) + ")");
}
Summary
Room Start Event: Updated to ensure the camera is correctly reassigned to follow the player instance when a new room starts.
General Camera Logic: Ensures the camera follows the player and the viewport is correctly updated.
These updates should address the issue where the camera stops following the player when they move to a different room. If issues persist, please provide specific error messages or additional context from the debug output log for further troubleshooting.

Ive added your code and its fixed alot of the bugs, ive updated the output log for you to review at penguinislegithub/debugoutput1.txt. Now the present bugs I noticed when testing the latest build are the player switching back to obj_player when first moving to a different room when the players skin has been switched to obj_player_icetruck. The second bug is sometimes when the player exits the icetruck and enters it again the obj_icetruck isnt properly removed. Can you take a look and debug.
To address the bugs with the player switching back to obj_player when moving to a different room and the obj_icetruck not being properly removed, let's review and debug the code.

Debug Output Analysis
Player Switching Back to obj_player:

When the player moves to a different room, the player is incorrectly reinitialized as obj_player instead of obj_player_icetruck.
obj_icetruck Not Properly Removed:

Sometimes, when the player exits the ice truck and enters it again, the obj_icetruck is not properly removed.
Updated obj_controller Room Start Event
Ensure that the player skin is correctly reinitialized when entering a new room and that the obj_icetruck is correctly handled.

gml
// Room Start Event for obj_controller

// Ensure the player skin is correctly reinitialized when entering a new room
var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

if (global.current_skin == "icetruck") {
    instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
    show_debug_message("Room Start: Reinitialized player as icetruck. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
} else {
    instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
    show_debug_message("Room Start: Reinitialized player as player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
}

// Ensure the viewport follows the current player instance
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    var view_x = clamp(global.player_instance.x - (view_wview[0] / 2), 0, room_width - view_wview[0]);
    var view_y = clamp(global.player_instance.y - (view_hview[0] / 2), 0, room_height - view_hview[0]);
    view_xview[0] = view_x;
    view_yview[0] = view_y;

    view_object[0] = global.player_instance;

    // Reattach camera to follow the player
    view_set_camera(0, global.camera);
    camera_set_view_pos(global.camera, view_x, view_y);

    // Debug message to ensure camera is moving
    show_debug_message("Camera at: (" + string(view_xview[0]) + ", " + string(view_yview[0]) + ")");
}
Updated obj_controller Switch Skin Function
Ensure that the obj_icetruck is correctly handled when the player exits and enters it again.

gml
// Function: switch_skin
function switch_skin(new_skin) {
    var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
    var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

    // Destroy current player instance if it exists
    if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {

Summary
Room Start Event: Ensures the player skin is correctly reinitialized when entering a new room and the obj_icetruck is correctly handled.
Switch Skin Function: Ensures the obj_icetruck is correctly destroyed and created when the player exits and enters it again.
These updates should address the issues with the player switching back to obj_player when moving to a different room and the obj_icetruck not being properly removed. If issues persist, please provide specific error messages or additional context from the debug output log for further troubleshooting.

I added the new code to the project and upade the output log for your review, penguinislegithub/debugoutput1.txt. The test has improved massively and ive very impressed. How ever one small bug remains, on occasion the obj_icetruck isnt properly removed from the room when exited. Can you identify the conflict causing the fault
To address the issue where the obj_icetruck isn't properly removed from the room when exited, let's review the relevant parts of the code and identify potential conflicts or errors.

From the debug output log and previous code snippets, it seems the issue might be related to how the obj_icetruck is being handled when the player exits it.

Ive added the code, ran a test and updated penguinislegithub/debugoutput1.txt so you can review the output log. Everything works how I intended however the only issue now is the players skin is reset when they enter a different room for the first time. im wondering if the particular objects in the different rooms are causing any confliction, I currently have rm_init as the first room with the creation code : global.player_start_x = 151; // Desired X coordinate
global.player_start_y = 159; // Desired Y coordinate

room_goto_next();
| and obj_controller, obj_camera and obj_initializer (in that order) placed in the room, the next room in order is rm_welcome_room which contains obj_controller, obj_camera and obj_initializer as well as obj_icetruck in the room, all the other rooms have also have obj_controller, obj_camera and obj_initializer and obj_icetruck in the room (so when the player exits the icetruck it will be drawn into the room. I want it to work like this. The player can approach any obj_icetruck in a room and interact with it to have the skin switch and obj_icetruck removed from the room. When the player exits the icetruck their skin should switch back to obj_player and obj_icetruck should be drawn back into the room. This should work regardless of wether obj_icetruck is in the room or not, aswell, can you inform me which obj's should have their persistent box checked for everthing to work. 
To ensure that the player's skin doesn't reset when entering a different room for the first time and to meet your other requirements, let's review and adjust the setup of your objects and their persistent states.

Persistent Objects
For your game to work as intended:

The obj_controller should be persistent to maintain global variables and control logic.
The obj_camera should be persistent to ensure it continues to follow the player across rooms.
The obj_initializer should be persistent to ensure any initialization logic is applied correctly across rooms.
The player objects (obj_player and obj_player_icetruck) should not be persistent since they are reinitialized based on the player's interaction.
Room Initialization
Ensure that the player's skin is correctly maintained when the player enters a room for the first time.

Updated Code for Room Initialization
Let's adjust the room initialization code and ensure the player's skin is correctly maintained.

Create Event for obj_controller
Ensure the player skin is correctly initialized based on the global state.

gml
// Create Event for obj_controller

// Initialize global variables if not already set
if (!variable_global_exists("player_start_x")) {
    global.player_start_x = 151;
}
if (!variable_global_exists("player_start_y")) {
    global.player_start_y = 159;
}
if (!variable_global_exists("current_skin")) {
    global.current_skin = "player";
}
if (!variable_global_exists("player_instance")) {
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(global.player_start_x, global.player_start_y, "Instances", obj_player);
}

// Debug message to ensure initialization
show_debug_message("Controller initialized. Player start at: (" + string(global.player_start_x) + ", " + string(global.player_start_y) + ")");
Room Start Event for obj_controller
Ensure the player skin is correctly reinitialized when entering a new room.

gml
// Room Start Event for obj_controller

// Ensure the player skin is correctly reinitialized when entering a new room
var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

if (global.current_skin == "icetruck") {
    instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
    show_debug_message("Room Start: Reinitialized player as icetruck. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
} else {
    instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
    show_debug_message("Room Start: Reinitialized player as player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
}

// Ensure the viewport follows the current player instance
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    var view_x = clamp(global.player_instance.x - (view_wview[0] / 2), 0, room_width - view_wview[0]);
    var view_y = clamp(global.player_instance.y - (view_hview[0] / 2), 0, room_height - view_hview[0]);
    view_xview[0] = view_x;
    view_yview[0] = view_y;

    view_object[0] = global.player_instance;

    // Reattach camera to follow the player
    view_set_camera(0, global.camera);
    camera_set_view_pos(global.camera, view_x, view_y);

    // Debug message to ensure camera is moving
    show_debug_message("Camera at: (" + string(view_xview[0]) + ", " + string(view_yview[0]) + ")");
}
Room Setup
Ensure obj_controller, obj_camera, and obj_initializer are placed in each room. obj_icetruck should be placed in rooms where the player can interact with it.

Persistent Checks
Persistent Objects:

obj_controller (to maintain global control logic)
obj_camera (to maintain camera state across rooms)
obj_initializer (to maintain initialization logic)
Non-Persistent Objects:

obj_player
obj_player_icetruck
obj_icetruck (since it can be created and destroyed based on player interaction)
Summary
Create Event for obj_controller: Initialize global variables and player instance.
Room Start Event for obj_controller: Reinitialize the player skin based on the global state and ensure the camera follows the player.
Persistent Checks: Ensure obj_controller, obj_camera, and obj_initializer are persistent.
These updates should ensure the player's skin doesn't reset when entering a different room for the first time, and the obj_icetruck is correctly handled. If issues persist, please provide specific error messages or additional context from the debug output log for further troubleshooting.

Thank you for that clarification, ive begun making the adjustments. Can you provide the full event code for obj_controller create and step events?
Sure! Here is the full event code for obj_controller including both the Create and Room Start events to ensure everything works as intended.

Create Event for obj_controller
This event initializes global variables and the player instance.

gml
// Create Event for obj_controller

// Initialize global variables if not already set
if (!variable_global_exists("player_start_x")) {
    global.player_start_x = 151;
}
if (!variable_global_exists("player_start_y")) {
    global.player_start_y = 159;
}
if (!variable_global_exists("current_skin")) {
    global.current_skin = "player";
}
if (!variable_global_exists("player_instance")) {
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(global.player_start_x, global.player_start_y, "Instances", obj_player);
}

// Set persistent flag for the controller to ensure it persists across rooms
persistent = true;

// Debug message to ensure initialization
show_debug_message("Controller initialized. Player start at: (" + string(global.player_start_x) + ", " + string(global.player_start_y) + ")");
Room Start Event for obj_controller
This event ensures the player skin is correctly reinitialized when entering a new room and that the camera follows the player.

gml
// Room Start Event for obj_controller

// Ensure the player skin is correctly reinitialized when entering a new room
var player_x = global.player_instance.x;
var player_y = global.player_instance.y;

if (global.current_skin == "icetruck") {
    // Ensure the ice truck is destroyed if it exists
    var ice_truck = instance_place(player_x, player_y, obj_icetruck);
    if (ice_truck != noone) {
        instance_destroy(ice_truck);
    }
    instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player_icetruck);
    show_debug_message("Room Start: Reinitialized player as icetruck. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
} else {
    instance_destroy(global.player_instance);
    global.player_instance = instance_create_layer(player_x, player_y, "Instances", obj_player);
    show_debug_message("Room Start: Reinitialized player as player. Player instance ID: " + string(global.player_instance));
}

// Ensure the viewport follows the current player instance
if (instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {
    var view_x = clamp(global.player_instance.x - (view_wview[0] / 2), 0, room_width - view_wview[0]);
    var view_y = clamp(global.player_instance.y - (view_hview[0] / 2), 0, room_height - view_hview[0]);
    view_xview[0] = view_x;
    view_yview[0] = view_y;

    view_object[0] = global.player_instance;

    // Reattach camera to follow the player
    view_set_camera(0, global.camera);
    camera_set_view_pos(global.camera, view_x, view_y);

    // Debug message to ensure camera is moving
    show_debug_message("Camera at: (" + string(view_xview[0]) + ", " + string(view_yview[0]) + ")");
}
Summary of Object Persistence
Persistent Objects:

obj_controller (to maintain control logic and global variables across rooms)
obj_camera (to ensure the camera follows the player across rooms)
obj_initializer (to maintain initialization logic across rooms)
Non-Persistent Objects:

obj_player
obj_player_icetruck
obj_icetruck
Additional Considerations
Ensure obj_controller, obj_camera, and obj_initializer are placed in each room.
obj_icetruck should be placed in rooms where the player can interact with it.
These adjustments should ensure everything works as intended and the player's skin doesn't reset when entering a different room for the first time. If you encounter any further issues, feel free to provide additional context or the debug output log for further troubleshooting.

Ive updated the output log (penguinislegithub/debugoutput1.txt) so you can review the latest test. I didnt get a chance to test your changes as the player wasnt visible when the game started and rm_welcome_room started. I think because of that the viewport wasnt following the player and stayed stationary, can you debug and fix this issue.
